Palestine-Israel Situation is NOT a Symmetrical Conflict


FACT 1: Origins of Palestine’s History
YEAR: 3,000 BCE
Palestine, documented as “Peleset” in ancient Egyptian records, has a deep history of diverse cultures and communities. Home to Assyrians, Nabataeans, Persians, Romans, and more, its cultural mix influences the Palestinian identity to this day.

FACT 2: Ottoman Rule Over Palestine
YEAR: 1516-1917
After defeating the Mamluks, the Ottomans ruled Palestine for over 400 years. They organized the region into districts like Jerusalem, Nablus, and Acre, with a population of approximately 600,000, primarily Muslim, with Jewish and Christian communities coexisting in relative peace.

FACT 3: The Rise of Zionism
YEAR: 1897
The first Zionist Congress met in Basel, Switzerland, promoting a Jewish state in Palestine. Zionist leaders, like Theodor Herzl, viewed the movement as colonial expansion, aiming to secure land despite the existing Palestinian population.

FACT 4: British Mandate and the Balfour Declaration
YEAR: 1922
Post-WWI, Palestine became a British mandate, with Britain backing Zionist settlement efforts. The 1917 Balfour Declaration supported a Jewish "national home" in Palestine, setting the stage for Zionist settlement in the region.
