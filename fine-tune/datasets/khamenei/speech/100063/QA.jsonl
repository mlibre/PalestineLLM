Its major patron, the United States, is confronting insolvable problems in the Middle East and facing increasing hatred from nations of the region and the world."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the significance of Palestine to the Islamic world mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Palestine is significant to the Islamic world because it constitutes a major part of the Islamic world's jihad on vast fronts against aggressive, ruthless, plunderous arrogant powers. The Islamic world has experienced an awakening, and the slogan of the rule of Islam in all Islamic countries is the major slogan among the youth, academics, and intellectuals of these countries."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the impact of Western liberal democracy on the Islamic Ummah mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Western liberal democracy has hurt the body and soul of the Islamic Ummah and burned the hearts of Muslims. Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Guantanamo, AbuGhuraib, and other secret dungeons have shown the real meaning of 'liberty' and 'Western human rights'. Today, Western liberal democracy is as disgraced and detested in the Islamic world as was the East's socialism and communism yesterday."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What do Muslim nations aspire to according to the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Muslim nations aspire to attain freedom, honor, progress, and dignity under the banner of Islam. They are fed up with the 200-year domination by alien and colonial powers and are tired of imposed poverty, suffering, and backwardness."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the duty of all Muslim nations regarding Palestine mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "All Muslim nations should treat the issue of Palestine as their own issue. Palestine should return to the Palestinian nation, and a single Palestinian government, elected by all Palestinians, should administer the entire Palestinian territories. The fifty-year efforts of Britain and the United States and Zionists to remove the word 'Palestine' from world maps and incorporate the Palestinian nation into other nations have proved futile."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the divine promise mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The divine promise mentioned in the speech is that Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them, and that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and that He will most certainly, after their fear, give them security in exchange; they shall serve Me, not associating aught with Me; and those who disbelieve henceforth, they are rebellious and wicked."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What kind of jihad is necessary for achieving freedom from domination in the Islamic world mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Achieving freedom from domination in the Islamic world is contingent on a jihad of a different kind, namely a scientific, political, and moral jihad. The Iranian nation has been engaged in this kind of jihad for the past 27 years and tasted its sweet results. The pillars of this sacred jihad are faith, philanthropy, and scholarship."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the main prerequisite for success in the jihad of Palestine and the Islamic world mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The main prerequisite for success in the jihad of Palestine and the Islamic world is insistence on principles. The enemy is always trying to subvert Islamic principles, and through deceits, promises, and threats, it is demanding that Muslims renounce their principles. If their principles are destroyed or diluted, Muslim nations will lose their guiding criteria and be subjected to the rules defined by the enemy."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the danger of exaggerating the power of the enemy mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Exaggerating the power of the enemy is one of the stratagems used by the enemy. Money, political and military force, and modern stockpiled weapons will scare those governments that are deprived of popular support. The military overpowering of a regime such as that of Saddam, who did not enjoy public support and whose army had no sense of faith and jihad, is not proof of power. The United States has not been able to overcome the Iraqi nation."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the significance of the chain of U.S. plots against Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon mentioned in the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The chain of U.S. plots against Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon is aimed at preparing the way for U.S. domination of the Middle East, with the Zionist regime holding supremacy in the region. However, these plots will never succeed and will yield nothing but fatal damage to U.S. politicians."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What should the U.S. administration do according to the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The U.S. administration should forgo its stubbornness and grudge against the Iraqi nation and submit to that nation's vote in favor of its elected government, respect the government elected by the Palestinian nation, rein in its rogue and villainous ally the usurper Zionist regime, immediately release the oppressed inmates who are locked up in Guantanamo, AbuGhuraib and its other secret prisons, stop hatching plots against Syria, Lebanon, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and not create tension in the sensitive Middle East region and the Persian Gulf through its ignorance."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What message does the speaker have for the Palestinian people at the end of the speech?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The speaker tells the valorous, steadfast Palestinian people that they have brought honor to the Islamic world through their jihad, patience, and brilliant resistance and become a model nation. Their heavy load of great sufferings has not bent their backs, and the immaculate blood of their martyrs has deepened their firm determination and perseverance. Their enemy, despite its brutality and bloodthirstiness, has not been able to push them back, and today they are stronger than ever. The blood of great martyrs has so far prevailed over the enemy's sword, and from now on also, by divine power, it will achieve greater victories."}]}
