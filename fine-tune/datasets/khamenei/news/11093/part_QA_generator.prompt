Title: Zionist regime kills 41,000 people but faces no bans!

Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, met with Iranian medalists and other members of the country’s delegations that took part in the 2024 Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games. The meeting took place in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024.
During the meeting, Imam Khamenei highlighted the remarkable abilities and the manifestation of the “national, political, and religious identity” of the Iranian nation as the foremost outcome of the Iranian athletes’ participation in these competitions.
The Leader conveyed immense joy at the opportunity to meet some of the nation's most cherished and proud children, stating, “With your medals and behavior, you have brought joy to the hearts of the nation. I sincerely thank you, the coaches, and all those involved.”
In the continuation of his speech, Imam Khamenei described international competitions as stages where nations showcase not only their physical strength and athletic skills but also their mental fortitude and self-confidence.
“In addition to demonstrating your professional and athletic abilities, through meaningful actions such as donating medals to children in Palestine and Gaza, maintaining your hijab and modesty, naming the delegation after the Infallible Imams (pbut) and taking selfies with the Palestinian flag, you have presented and honored your spiritual capabilities as well as your national-religious and Islamic identity,” he said.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution also pointed out the continuous efforts of ill-wishers to distort the “identity, truth, and beliefs” of the Iranian nation. “They claim that religious sentiments have weakened in Iran, but when our champion kisses the Quran in front of perhaps hundreds of millions of viewers and offers a prostration of gratitude [to God], the reality and identity of the Iranian nation, their adherence to their beliefs, and their dedication to Iran’s national greatness becomes prominent. Such remarkable signs were evident in your performance,” he remarked.
He highlighted the optimism that sports champions bring to society through their medal-winning achievements, stating, “Some individuals become despondent over a minor physical incident, but when our young athlete demonstrates strength in the Paralympics while seated in a wheelchair, it fills everyone's hearts with hope.”
Imam Khamenei underscored the tangibility of the double standards and biased policies of the countries governing international sports during the recent Olympic and Paralympic Games. He noted that while one country is banned from participating due to war, the Zionist regime continues to be included in the competitions, despite killing 41,000 people, including thousands of children, over the course of nearly a year.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added that, “These double standards and biased policies, as we have repeatedly pointed out, demonstrate that despite the assertion of sports being free from politics, the most politically driven actions are exercised in the realm of sports.”
Elsewhere in his remarks, Imam Khamenei addressed Iranian officials, urging them to recognize and support athletes who, because of their national or religious beliefs, choose not to compete against representatives of the Zionist regime. He acknowledged that these athletes are making a significant sacrifice and advised sporting officials to pay attention to these athletes as part of their duties.
At the beginning of this meeting, Ahmad Donyamali, Iran’s Sports and Youth minister, reported on the achievements of the Iranian athletes who participated in the 2024 Paris Olympic and Paralympic competitions. He proudly remarked, “In total, the flag of our beloved Iran was raised 37 times at the competition venues.”
During the meeting, Sareh Javanmardi, a holder of several gold medals in shooting from various Paralympic Games, along with Aryan Salimi, a gold medalist in taekwondo at the Paris Olympics, and Rouhollah Rostami, Iran's golden champion in Paralympic weightlifting, conveyed their appreciation on behalf of the athletes for the prayers, congratulatory messages, and the support that they have received from the Leader of the Islamic Revolution. They also extended their gratitude to him for highlighting the spiritual significance of Iran’s champions in these competitions.
