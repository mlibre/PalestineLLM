Iran Leaderâ€™s Address to the 3rd Intl. Conference on the Holy Quds and Support for the Palestinian People
----


In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful

All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon the great trustworthy prophet and upon his immaculate household and noble companions.

I welcome you, the dear guests, scholars, intellectuals, statesmen, those engaged in jihad in the way of Allah and defenders of the ideological and jihadi frontiers of Islam. You have convened here to exchange views and find a remedy for the occupation of Palestine and the Holy Quds, the worst catastrophe that has happened to the Islamic Ummah in the present era owing to the plots and machinations of colonial powers.

The coincidence of this conference and the birth anniversary of the Holy Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his immaculate household) in the year that has been designated by the Iranian nation as the 'Year of the Holy Prophet' should inspire all of us with a spirit of striving in the way of Allah, unity, determination and deep trust in divine promise and, God willing, it should prepare the ground for the bestowal of divine mercy and victory.

The present age is the era of Islamic awakening, and Palestine lies at the center of this awakening. Almost sixty years have passed since the occupation of Palestine, and the oppressed Palestinian people have endured hard times and undergone various trials, ranging from desperate empty-handed resistance following the occupation, homelessness and displacement, witnessing the destruction of their homes and the massacre of their relatives and dear ones to seeking assistance from international organizations and engaging in futile political deals and the gamble of negotiation with the occupier, a gamble that yielded nothing but a heavy loss, and the mediation of those powers that were the main culprits in the creation and continuation of their plight and suffering.

The outcome of this historic experience helped the new zealous generation of this valorous nation to reach the summit of awakening and broad-mindedness and caused the volcano of the Intifada to erupt.

On the opposite front also various steps were taken on a different path, ranging from merciless and unbridled ferocity, genocide and wrathful demolition, military aggression against neighbors and claims to the territories from the Nile to the Euphrates, to political and economic encroachment on the region by profiting from the weakness and betrayal on the part of certain politicians of the Islamic world and, all of a sudden, confronting the awakening of the sleeping lion of Palestine and the roaring Intifada of a nation fed up with and rising against oppression.

Today, the product of this adventurous process, which was reliant all the time on the money and might of the United States and Britain and their shameful support for Zionist criminals, is wavering and despair on the part of those ruling the usurper Zionist regime and their coming face to face with the sweeping wave of rising Islamic awakening.

It is true that Palestine is even today the scene of the most heinous crimes in human history being committed by alien and usurper Zionists against the oppressed owners of Palestinian territories, and the most brutal atrocities are being openly and boastfully perpetrated by the Zionist regime in an unprecedented manner.

However, a glance at what has happened over the past sixty years reveals a surprising reality, which serves as a lesson, and this reality is nothing but a great change on the scene and the shift of power from one front to the other both in Palestine and in the Middle East and the Islamic world.

As a matter of fact, Western politicians had planned and given rise to the tragedy of the usurpation of Palestine with the intention of ensuring their long-term control and domination of Palestinian territories.

Think of the Palestine of the 1940's: a land in the heart of the Arab world, a poor country with a weak government and an unaware nation and some neighbors installed by colonial powers. The wealthiest and most evil Western government with the greatest stockpile of arms and weapons, provoked by the Zionists, took it away from Muslims and entrusted it to a racist, belligerent and terrorist party which received support from all Western countries and from both of the world's two political blocs that were at odds with each other.

It also received services from the puppet regimes in the region, including the Pahlavi regime in Iran and others that had turned their backs on Islam and Arab nations. It was provided with money, weapons, science and technology from everywhere. The United States acted as its guardian, attorney and caterer, and this was the only issue on which the former Soviet Union expressed no disagreement with the United States.

The UN resolutions, even in their weak and conservative form, were utterly ignored by the forged and rogue Zionist regime. Relying on the backing and support on the part of the United States and Europe, the Zionist regime launched a military offensive on Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon and occupied some parts of their territories with the intention of annexing them.

The Zionist regime openly and audaciously made threats to assassinate, kill and plunder, and notorious terrorists took power one after another in this regime, the last of whom was the infamous butcher of 'Sabra and Shatila'. For tens of years, the usurper Zionist regime remained on the scene of Palestine with a violent, inflexible and invincible face.

On the opposite front, following initial weakness and abjection and failure of the half-done efforts of early years, various ideologies from pan-Arabism and nationalism to leftist views such as Marxism and the like were put to the test, and they all proved to be unsuccessful in practice.

However, religious faith, to which the Palestinian nation strongly adheres, gradually created some bright spots on the dark and gloomy horizon, thanks to the firm determination of patient and persevering mujahedin, and gave rise to hopes and motivation. At this time, the sun of 'Islamic Revolution' suddenly rose in the east, and the hoisted flag of this divine revolution was embellished with the words 'Allah', 'the Islamic Sharia' and 'Palestine'.

From this time on, the events began to take a different course, and the process of downfall of the usurper regime and decline in the absolute domination of the region by the United Sates, which had for many years acted as an accomplice with the usurper regime, was initiated.

The jihadi groups devoted to Islam emerged in Palestine and Lebanon and constituted a generation of dedicated and determined combatants. Jihad and martyrdom were revitalized and the genuine power, namely the power of a nation that was intent on resistance and self-sacrifice, attained its due status in the equations of Palestine and the region.

The immaculate blood of martyrdom-seeking youngsters and the presence on the scene of devoted combatants ready to make self-sacrifice refuted all the calculations of materialistic mammonists pursuing riches and pleasure and opened a new arena in which blood achieved victory over the sword.
