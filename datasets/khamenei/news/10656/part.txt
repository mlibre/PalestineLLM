What is going on in Gaza hospitals?

From the onset of the Zionist regime's ruthless attacks on Gaza, supporters of the Palestinian cause have tirelessly worked to share the plight of Gaza's residents. Additionally, significant endeavors have been made to commemorate the names of every martyr of these atrocities. Today, one name, “Amir Abu Aisha,” has gained particular prominence in the media.

The Palestinian Red Crescent has announced that the deceased body of Amir Abu Aisha, a member of the medical team at Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Yunis, was fatally shot by Zionist soldiers near the hospital and is unable to be buried due to ongoing shootings and bombings by the Israeli military surrounding the area. Today, the unburied remains of Amir Abu Aisha serve as a stark reminder, telling the world a story of the relentless Zionist atrocities within Gaza hospitals.

Al-Shifa Hospital: Target of Zionist resentment for its resilience

March 24, 2024 marks the seventh consecutive day of Zionists’ second attack on Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. Disturbing images and accounts of this assault have circulated widely. According to some reports, Zionist soldiers are apprehending, abusing, interrogating, and even executing individuals within the hospital premises, obstructing the removal of bodies and the delivery of aid. There have been instances where direct gunfire from Zionist soldiers has resulted in fatalities among both civilians and medical staff. Additionally, severe shortages of food and medical supplies have led to the deaths of more than twelve Palestinians due to hunger and inadequate resources. Since last night, Zionists have also brazenly entered the hospital, claiming to be searching for an underground Resistance tunnel network, but instead, they have detained or killed individuals without regard for their safety.

In another instance, on the morning of November 15, Zionists launched an assault on Al-Shifa Hospital, employing military gear and explosives to strike the emergency ward. This attack, happening in the initial phases of the conflict, prompted widespread international reactions. Addressing the plight of children at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, consistently urged for an immediate halt to hostilities, emphasizing, "The world cannot remain silent as hospitals, meant to be sanctuaries, turn into arenas of death, devastation, and hopelessness".

The residents and Resistance fighters in the northern Gaza Strip have effectively communicated the Zionists' defeat in this war to the global community through their mere presence in this area. It appears that the Zionists seek revenge for their loss by targeting the largest hospital in the region of northern Gaza.

Hospitals under fire since the early days

The bombing of Al-Maamadani Hospital on October 17, 2023, shocked the world, evoking anger and sorrow. The hospital, providing refuge for thousands of women and children, tragically witnessed the deaths of about 500 Palestinians and injuries to around 10,000 individuals. The global outcry forced the authorities of the Zionist regime and its Western ally, the US, to try to shift blame onto the Resistance. The ongoing attacks by the Zionist regime on hospitals have desensitized the world to this egregious war crime, emboldening them to commit countless atrocities in Gaza hospitals without fear of repercussions. Consequently, the Zionist regime no longer feels compelled to deny its hospital attacks.

On December 16, Zionist military forces launched an attack on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, using bulldozers to excavate mass temporary graves around the hospital and removing the bodies of Palestinian martyrs. Asmaa Tanteesh, the head of nursing at Kamal Adwan Hospital, vividly describes the horrifying events that transpired at the medical facility: “The bodies outside in the courtyard were plowed in front of our eyes. … All the while, we were shouting and screaming at them, but our screams fell on deaf ears.” Satellite imagery taken before and after the incident depicts the scarred landscape surrounding Kamal Adwan Hospital. Additionally, videos and images showing decaying body parts strewn across the hospital grounds have been circulated.

Targeting sick Palestinian children: Routine for bloodthirsty Zionists

On November 10, 2023, the Zionist regime bombed and set fire to the Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital. Witnessing a sick child forced into hospitalization is heart-wrenching enough to break anyone's heart. Despite efforts by specialized pediatric care centers to minimize pain and psychological stress, scenes of injecting serum or an ampoule into a child, or seeing a child with a limb tied up in bandages, are distressing for any human. The thought of hospitals being set ablaze with these innocent children inside is even more agonizing. Nonetheless, the Zionists didn't hesitate to do so, aiming to further oppress the people of Gaza into forsaking their ideals. Unfortunately, the attack on the children's hospital got lost amidst the deluge of grim news emanating from Gaza.

Cancer and the Zionist regime: Two entities with a common root

On October 30, 2023, the Zionist regime inflicted severe damage on the Gaza Strip's only specialized cancer hospital, rendering it non-functional. Alongside this disease, the Zionist regime aggressively pursues the destruction of Palestinian lives. Furthermore, it has hindered the entry of essential medications for cancer patients into the Gaza Strip.

The Zionist regime has continuously breached United Nations Resolution 2675 and has conducted raids on Palestinian civilian gathering centers using weak pretexts. This occupying regime, devoid of any legitimate reason to engage with Palestinian military forces, relentlessly targets unarmed civilians, including hospitals, escalating the pressures of war upon them.

Imam Khamenei, in his remarks on November 19, 2023, elucidated the motive behind the hospital attacks:

From the start, they have said that their goal is to annihilate and cripple Hamas and the Resistance. But they have been unable to do this. … The reason they are dropping bombs on people's heads is because they are enraged by this defeat. The Zionist regime is enraged now. It’s upset. That’s why it’s committing these crimes. It bombs hospitals, it bombs ill patients, and it bombs women and children because it has been defeated.

The widespread atrocities perpetrated by the occupying regime in Gaza, especially within hospitals, have starkly exposed the true nature of the Zionists to people around the globe. The pressing need to adopt the idea that the removal of this malignant force from the West Asian region is the only viable solution to stop these atrocities becomes increasingly evident day by day
