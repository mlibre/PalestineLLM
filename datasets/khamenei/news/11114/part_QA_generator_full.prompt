Title: Palestinian Resistance and Hezbollah are victorious

In a meeting with thousands of veterans and active members of the Sacred Defense and the Resistance, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, outlined the reasons behind the start of the Imposed War. He emphasized the importance of the "new message" and the "attractions" of the Islamic Republic, which starkly contrast with the corrupt and false global order.
The meeting took place in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on Wednesday, September 25, 2024, on the occasion of Sacred Defense Week. During the meeting, Imam Khamenei underscored, “The Sacred Defense, in addition to being a valuable defense of the homeland, was also a defense of religion and fighting on the path of God. It breathed new life into Islam, honored the Iranian nation, and fostered a spiritual spirit throughout the country.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the current events in Palestine and Lebanon as akin to the events of the Sacred Defense era, emphasizing that they represent a form of “Jihad on the path of God.”
He stated that Palestine, as an Islamic nation, has been usurped by the most malevolent infidels in the world.
“The definitive religious ruling is that it is obligatory upon everyone to strive and help to return Palestine and Al-Aqsa Mosque to the Muslims and its rightful owners,” he asserted.
Imam Khamenei stated, “Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which is standing up for Gaza and enduring these bitter events, is engaging in fighting on the path of God.”
While pointing out the similarities between the current battle and the eight-year imposed war, the Leader stated, “In this battle, the infidel and evil enemy is equipped with the best resources. The US is behind them. The Americans claim that they are not involved and are unaware of things, which is false. Not only are they aware and involved, they also require the victory of the Zionist regime.”
“Because of the upcoming elections, the current US administration needs to demonstrate that it has supported the Zionist regime and helped it achieve victory. However, they also need the votes of Muslims, so they pretend that they are not involved,” he added.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution emphasized the Zionist enemy’s access to substantial financial resources, weaponry, and global propaganda. He stated, “The equipment and resources of the believers and the Mujahideen are a fraction of what the opposite side possesses. Nevertheless, victory lies with those who fight in the path of God, namely the Palestinian Resistance and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.”
Imam Khamenei attributed the successes of the Resistance Front to the crimes perpetrated by the Zionist regime, which include large-scale massacres of innocents, women, and children, alongside the bombings of schools and hospitals. He emphasized that had the Zionist regime the capability to vanquish fighters in Gaza, the West Bank, or Lebanon, it would not resort to such heinous acts as a means to project an illusion of dominance and superiority.
He regarded the blows inflicted on the Resistance forces and the martyrdom of effective and valuable elements of Lebanon’s Hezbollah as a loss for this valiant group. “These losses will not bring Hezbollah to its knees, for its organizational and military prowess, as well as its authority, far exceed these matters,” he said.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution emphasized, “Up until today, the Resistance Front have emerged victorious, and by God’s grace, the ultimate victory in this battle will belong to the Resistance Front.”
Elsewhere in his speech, Imam Khamenei elaborated on the motivations behind Saddam Hussein’s war against the Iranian nation in 1980. “The impetus for the attack on Iran's borders was not limited to Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath Party. Rather, the leaders of the global order at the time, namely the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their allies, also had strong motivations for the invasion,” he remarked.
He attributed the hostility of superpowers towards the unprecedented popular Iranian Revolution to the “unbearable” nature of its new ideology and message. “Their animosity stemmed from the fact that the Islamic Revolution was a clear cry against the false and destructive order prevailing in the world as well as the imperialist system, that divides the world into oppressors and the oppressed, imposing the culture and views of the oppressors on other countries.”
Highlighting the unwillingness of superpowers to accept the new message of the Islamic Revolution – one that possessed the potential for widespread appeal across nations – the Leader remarked, “These nations were poised to seize any opportunity to launch an attack on Iran. At the same time, Saddam, who was an ambitious, greedy, impudent, oppressive, and reckless person, provided the powers with this opportunity and by instigating them, he initiated an attack against Iran.”
Imam Khamenei emphasized that today, owing to the steadfastness and active participation of the Iranian nation in various arenas, no adversary dares to attack Iran's borders. “Today, they are engaged in mischief and hostility in a different form, and we must understand deeply that the reasons for their animosity derives not from pretexts such as nuclear energy, human rights, or women's rights. Rather, it stems from their opposition to the Islamic Republic’s new narrative that challenges the corrupt global order,” he asserted.
In reflecting upon Iran’s unfavorable circumstances at the onset of the imposed war in terms of its military equipment and combat organization, the Leader noted, “According to predictions and conventional material standards, the invading forces should have reached Tehran within one to several weeks. However, after a year had passed, our initially disadvantaged troops secured remarkable victories and delivered lethal blows to Saddam's well-equipped army. Ultimately, after eight years, they were expelled from our country's borders. The main factors underpinning this victory were faith and struggle.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution highlighted the fact that the war was not limited to the defense of the nation, which is a noble endeavor in itself. Rather, it was a sacred duty, a defense of Islam, and a fulfillment of a Quranic command, known in Islamic literature as “fighting on the path of God.”
Imam Khamenei emphasized that the Sacred Defense was instrumental in keeping the Revolution and Islam alive. “As a result, the battlefields turned into places of worship, prayer, supplications, midnight weeping, and selfless service. It was with due to this spiritual fervor that the Almighty God bestowed dignity, support, and victory upon the Iranian nation,” he said.
