Title: The US will be forced to stop backing the Zionist regime

In a live televised speech on June 3, 2024, marking the 35th anniversary of Imam Khomeini’s demise, Imam Khamenei, Leader of the Islamic Revolution, elaborated on the importance and prominence of the Palestinian issue in the late Imam Khomeini’s views and approaches.
During this ceremony, held in the Mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution emphasized, “From the very first day of the Islamic Movement, Imam [Khomeini] highlighted the Palestinian issue and, with foresight and scrutiny, he predicted the path ahead for the Palestinian nation. This very important insight of the Imam is gradually being realized.”
Imam Khamenei described the purpose of the annual gathering as a means to honor Imam Khomeini’s memory and to apply his teachings towards the administration and progress of the country, as well as the realization of the Revolution’s objectives.
In the first part of his speech, Imam Khamenei explained the importance of the Palestinian issue in the thoughts and opinions of the late Imam Khomeini, emphasizing the rejection of reliance on so-called peace negotiations, the active participation of the Palestinian people in taking back their rights, as well as all nations’ help, especially that of the Muslim nations for the Palestinian people. These principles, according to the Leader, embody Imam Khomeini’s vision for the ultimate victory of the Palestinians. He further highlighted that these significant developments are currently unfolding.
Imam Khamenei pointed out that the Zionist regime has become trapped in a corner due to the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, adding that, “Even though the US and many Western governments continue to support this regime, they too are aware that there is no escape for the occupying regime.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution expounded on two important features of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, which include fulfilling the significant needs of the region and dealing a decisive blow to the criminal regime. “A comprehensive, broad plan for the region had been devised by the US, Zionist elements, their followers, and certain governments in the region. This comprehensive plan aimed to reshape regional relations and dynamics, [Their goal was to] establish relations between the Zionist regime and regional governments based on the wishes of that regime. This in turn meant that the Zionist regime would not only attain domination over the politics and economy of the entire region of West Asia, but also over the entire Islamic world” he stated.
Imam Khamenei noted that, “This sinister plan was on the verge of execution when the miraculous Al-Aqsa Flood began and disrupted the Zionist regime's comprehensive plan to dominate the politics and economy of the entire region of West Asia, in such a way that considering the events of the past eight months, there is no hope that they will be able to revive this plan.” 
He attributed the unprecedented crimes and boundless brutality of the insane regime, as well as the US government's support for these atrocities, to agitated reactions towards the disruption of the grand international conspiracy that planned to allow the Zionist regime dominate the region.
To illustrate the gravity of the surge in reverse migration in the occupied territories, Imam Khamenei referenced the words of a Zionist security analyst. "This Zionist analyst says, If the content of the discussions and conflicts going on between Israeli officials are published by the media, four million people will leave Israel.'"
Imam Khamenei highlighted the significant transformation of the Palestinian issue into a global priority. He noted the widespread anti-Zionist demonstrations in London, Paris, and US universities, emphasizing the increasing awareness and attention to the plight of the Palestinian people. “For many years, American-Zionist propaganda and media centers have made an effort to make people forget the Palestinian issue. But in the light of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation and the resilience of the people of Gaza, Palestine is now at the forefront of global issues,” he noted.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the sufferings of the people of Gaza, including the martyrdom of approximately 40 thousand people and the killing of about 15 thousand children, babies and infants, as a heavy price that the Palestinian nation is paying in their struggle for liberation from the oppression of the Zionists. He praised the people of Gaza for their unwavering resilience and defense of their Resistance fighters, attributing it to their strong faith in Islam and the teachings of the Quran.
Imam Khamenei remarked that the miscalculation of the Zionist regime regarding the capabilities of the great Resistance Front led to the regime’s current dead end. The Zionist regime, he noted, will suffer these continuous defeats one after another. And with God’s power and strength, it will never find a way to save itself.
In his concluding remarks, Imam Khamenei stated, “Despite the West's propaganda, The Zionist regime is gradually melting before the eyes of the people of the world. It is coming to an end. In addition to the nations, many world politicians, and even the Zionists, have recognized this reality.”
In the second part of his speech, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution discussed the martyrdom of the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage, who passed away in a tragic helicopter crash last month. “Each of the president's companions was a valuable figure in their own right,” he remarked.
In describing the outstanding and prominent characteristics of Martyr Raisi, Imam Khamenei noted, “Everyone acknowledged that he was a man of action, service, and honesty. He set a new standard in the field of service which had never been seen before at this level, volume, and quality. His sincerity and hard work were unparalleled among those serving the country.”
The Leader underscored that Martyr Raisi’s other notable qualities included his dynamic and successful foreign policy, his skill in seizing opportunities, and his success in raising Iran's profile among world leaders. Additionally, he highlighted Martyr Raisi’s clear demarcation from the enemies and opponents of the Revolution and his distrust of the enemy's smiles as further indicators of his character.
Imam Khamenei also praised late Iranian Foreign Minister, Martyr Amir-Abdollahian, as an active, hard-working, innovative, and skilled, intelligent negotiator who adhered to the principles of the Islamic Republic.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution highlighted the million-strong turnout of people at the funeral processions and farewell ceremonies of the “Martyrs of Service” as a remarkable and noteworthy event, praising it as an example of the Iranian nation's epic-making in the face of bitter and difficult events throughout the history of the Revolution.
On the same note, Imam Khamenei remarked, “This epic demonstrated that the Iranian nation is a motivated, resilient, and enduring people who will not be defeated by adversity; rather, their resolve and determination will only grow stronger.”
Imam Khamenei regarded the people's epic presence as another message of support for the mottos of the Revolution. He stated, "The late Mr. Raisi was an outspoken advocate of the mottos of the Revolution and he embodied these principles."
Elsewhere in his remarks, the Leader considered the upcoming presidential elections in Iran as a momentous undertaking and a highly rewarding phenomenon. “If these elections are conducted properly and with great splendor and magnificence, it will be a significant achievement for the Iranian nation and it will resonate powerfully throughout the world,” he said. 
In his concluding remarks, Imam Khamenei underscored that the people's epic participation in the elections will complete their epic farewell to the martyrs. "The Iranian nation requires an active, hardworking, knowledgeable, and principled president who believes in the principles of the Revolution in order to safeguard their interests and solidify their strategic depth in complex international equations," he stated.
