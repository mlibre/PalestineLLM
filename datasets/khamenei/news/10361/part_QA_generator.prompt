Title: US’s veto-bombs keep falling on Gaza

While some assert that body language serves as a universal means of communication, evidence contradicts these claims. Nevertheless, the raised right hand of the US ambassador during the United Nations Security Council meeting on December 8, 2023, was unmistakably interpreted by the pilots of the Zionist regime's fighter jets. Similar to the signals used by airport air traffic controllers, the ambassador's hand indicated approval for the flight and bombing raids targeting Palestinian homes in Gaza.[i]

Since the onset of the brutal military aggression by the Zionist regime on the Gaza Strip following the historic Operation Al-Aqsa Flood on October 7, the United States has consistently taken a stance opposing the establishment of a ceasefire and bringing an end to the bloodshed in Gaza. Although, during this period, officials in Washington have at times tried to present themselves as disturbed by the events in Gaza, their actions speak louder than words, revealing a duplicitous effort to sustain continuous political cover for the ongoing massacre of non-combatants in the besieged Gaza enclave.

Washington has employed a significant tool, their veto power, without hesitation to provide political protection for the war crimes committed by the Zionist regime against Palestinian women and children. Despite occasionally expressing concerns that may seem insincere, Washington's actions consistently demonstrate a steadfast commitment to ensuring political cover for the continuous atrocities against civilians in the confined spaces of Gaza.

Once again, the United States exercised its veto power in the Security Council on October 16, blocking a proposed resolution by Russia that called for an immediate ceasefire. Similarly, on October 18, Washington vetoed a resolution presented by Brazil, emphasizing the urgent need to halt the aggressive attacks by the Zionist regime on the Gaza Strip. [ii]This highlights Washington's recurring use of its veto power as a powerful tool to politically support the Zionist regime, defying international calls for an immediate ceasefire.

However, it should not be overlooked that exercising the veto power against Security Council resolutions does not necessarily imply the commitment and adherence of the United States to the adopted resolutions. For instance, one can point to the non-compliance of the United States with a resolution passed on November 16, which focused on the 'immediate establishment of humanitarian ceasefires' in Gaza.[iii] Despite the approval of Security Council members for this resolution, proposed by Malta, the Americans never implemented it.

What were the resolutions of Russia and Brazil?

Brazil, in its proposed resolution, emphasized the necessity of establishing ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of this enclave. The resolution also stressed the need to halt the forced displacement of Palestinians from the north to the south of Gaza. However, Brazil, in its proposed resolution, also took into account the interests and benefits of the Zionist regime, condemning the October 7 operation of Hamas. The resolution also asked for the release of Israeli prisoners arrested by Hamas.[iv] Despite the special attention given to the interests of the Zionists in the Brazilian resolution, the United States' unwavering support for the Zionists prevented them from even accepting the most basic rights of the Palestinians, namely, the receipt of humanitarian aid.

In the draft of the proposed Russian resolution, the need to open humanitarian corridors was also emphasized. The Russian representative in the Security Council described the resolution as a "purely humanitarian text" and stated, "This draft condemns all forms of violence and calls for the opening of humanitarian corridors and the release of all captives.”[v]

 

Why did Washington resort to the 'veto power'?"

Using the veto right against the Palestinians and in support of the Zionist regime illustrates that the US has no intention of initiating a ceasefire in Gaza or putting an end to the unprecedented genocide in this small enclave. One major factor contributing to this is Washington's reluctance to hinder the forced displacement of Gaza residents.

In a resolution proposed by Brazil, it explicitly declared that Israel must immediately cease all attempts for the forced relocation of Gazans. [vi]Therefore, by vetoing this resolution, the Americans essentially permitted the Zionists to persist in evicting Palestinians from their homes and shelters in Gaza.

Another reason prompting Washington to accelerate its political backing for the regime known for child killings in international forums was the absence of explicit references to 'Israel's right to self-defense' in ceasefire resolutions. The third factor was that, contrary to Washington's belief, none of the resolutions identified the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas, as a terrorist organization.[vii] Another aspect of the United States' use of veto power in favor of Israel can be seen in the official statements and positions of Washington's authorities.

In this context, the US representative in the United Nations Security Council, explaining the reason for vetoing Russia's proposed resolution on October 16, stated: “Hamas is not mentioned in this resolution. We cannot allow the responsibility for what is happening in Gaza to fall on Israel's shoulders.”[viii] In the October 18 session, he reiterated the rationale for vetoing Brazil's resolution, emphasizing: “There is no reference to Israel's right to self-defense in this resolution.” [ix]This statement was made despite the absence of any international laws or resolutions that consider the indiscriminate massacre of women, children, and the elderly by Zionists in Gaza as an example of 'self-defense.'

 

What do the statistics indicate?

The statistics and figures indicate that since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, the United States has used the veto power 82 times, with half of them, namely 46 times, in support of the Zionist regime and against the Palestinian cause.[x]

One of the crucial resolutions in support of the Palestinian cause was Resolution 3236, introduced by the United Nations General Assembly in 1976. This resolution officially acknowledged the 'right to self-determination' for Palestinians. However, the Americans vetoed it, undermining its credibility. This suggests that Washington denied Palestinians even the most fundamental right enjoyed by the inhabitants of any land. In 1980, a resolution condemning the Zionist regime's settlements in East Jerusalem was also vetoed by Washington.[xi]

The table below shows the resolutions that the United States has vetoed in the United Nations Security Council in support of the Zionist regime.[xii]

The use of 'veto power': A prominent example of Washington's support for Tel Aviv

the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in his recent meeting with Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, emphasized: “The crimes of the Zionist regime [against Palestine and Gaza] are carried out with direct support from the United States and some Western countries.” It is evident that the use of the veto power is considered one of the prominent examples of this direct support by Washington for the Zionists.

As it appears, the veto power has always been a powerful 'diplomatic weapon' for the United States to support the aggressive policies of the Zionist apartheid regime. Each time the Americans vetoed resolutions presented to the United Nations Security Council in support of the Palestinian cause, they provided a green light to the Zionist regime to pursue its evil policies against Palestinians. These include the continuation of settlements, Judaization of occupied Jerusalem, forced displacement of Palestinians from their homes, arbitrary arrests of Palestinian citizens, desecration of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, arming settlers for the slaughter of Palestinian civilians, further confiscation of Palestinian lands, blindly arresting the Palestinian people, the ongoing siege of Gaza, and more. Accordingly, Washington continues its tradition of supporting Israel by vetoing resolutions aimed at achieving a ceasefire in Gaza, signaling a consistent stance.
