Title: US must take responsibility for the genocide in Gaza

The following is an interview with Dr. Foad Izadi, associate professor of American Studies at the University of Tehran, about the kind and degree of relation between the US and Zionist regime, especially in the context of the Zionist regime’s recent genocidal invasion of Gaza.
Question: What is the nature of relations between US and the Zionist regime?
F. Izadi: This question comes up sometimes: Does the Zionist regime have control or influence over the US, or does the US have influence over the Zionist regime? Now, the answer to this question is important, especially in the discussions that we have had in the past few days.
The way I understand it, considering the Zionist regime and the US government as separate entities is not a very accurate. Any analysis that separates these two from each other is not a correct analysis. My understanding is that the Zionist regime and the US regime cannot be dissociated. What this means is that there are a group of Zionist personalities who are inside the US, and some others are inside the occupied territories. Many of them are active in the business environment. And they have influence in the Zionist regime and in the US because of the structure of the American regime. They gained influence in the US because of the monetary dependence of politicians on the money of capitalists. And the people who are present in the field of West Asian issues in various American institutions are often identified and selected by the opinion and influence of this group of Zionists. This has traditionally existed in the past few decades.
This matter became more pronounced during the Biden administration. In Mr. Biden's administration, for the first time, the US Secretary of State is a Zionist, the head of the US intelligence agencies is a Zionist, the head of the US Department of Homeland Security is a Zionist, and the head of Biden's office is also a Zionist. We’ve never seen the US administration in this form before. The secretary of the treasury, for example, is a Zionist. We have never witnessed so many ministers and heads of security intelligence institutions who were Zionists. In other words, the traditional influence that the Zionists have had on the structure of the American government has heightened in the Biden administration. It was not like this in the Trump administration. It wasn’t like this in the previous administrations either. For example, Nixon’s foreign minister was Kissinger, who was a Zionist. But that was it. And these people that you’ve seen, for example, Mr. Blinken, who visited the occupied territories a few days ago, announced at the airport and in other places that he is a Jew. So, they practically consider themselves as Israelis and their top priority is Israel.
And you can’t distinguish him as the US Secretary of State. This type of differentiation is incorrect. Thus, in my opinion, asking about who is influencing whom is incorrect. Because the discussion of America's influence on Israel or Israel's influence on the US becomes meaningful when they are separate. This question can be raised only when they are detached.
So, who influences whom? When they are one entity, when they have the same elements, when they share the same concerns, having an influence does not have much meaning. Of course, this does not mean that they have no differences. Just as there are differences within the American government, just as there are differences within the Zionist regime, there may be differences between those who are active in the field of discussions about the Zionist regime in the US and vice versa. And these differences can be quite serious. But it is merely a difference in their tactics and Zionism is in their nature.
Now, they might be critical toward Netanyahu. For example, Biden is critical of Netanyahu. The fact of the matter is that yes, there may be criticism and disagreements. However, Netanyahu is being criticized because they believe that this style of governance will ultimately bring challenges for Israel. In other words, because of their interest in Israel and the future of Israel, there are questions and criticisms and differences of opinion about Netanyahu.
Question: If you want to locate this “inseparable relation” existing between the US and Zionist regime in the present situation, I mean the Operation Al Aqsa Storm and then the Zionists’ genocidal, brutal bombings of Gaza, how would you do it?
F. Izadi: As I explained the Zionist regime and the US regime are essentially one entity. They are inseparable. And for this reason, when the Zionist regime faced this great defeat, it was also a great defeat for the US. Why? Because they are one entity. The military weakness or intelligence weakness that the Zionist regime has suffered can also be considered as the military and intelligence weakness of America.
Why? Because the weapons they use are American weapons. Their equipment and devices are mainly provided by the US. Their training is provided by the US. The Americans carry out extensive intelligence work in the field of Palestine. So, this is a defeat in Israel’s intelligence and it is also a defeat in US intelligence. And because of these points that I mentioned, when it became clear that Israel had suffered this defeat, the Americans came to the middle of the field and took over the management of the affairs that were taking place. When this incident happened, because of the United States’ concerns for Israel, and since they are one and the same, the Americans basically took over. In a period of a few hours, it was the American CENTCOM that took over the field. Why? Because it turned out that Netanyahu has serious weaknesses, that the management structure in the Zionist regime has serious weaknesses and has suffered a big defeat.
For this reason, the Americans themselves entered the field, and it has been going on like this until today. That is why Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, stressed that the Americans must take responsibility. They must definitely take responsibility because it is their doing. The project carried out in the last ten days and all the things that have occurred so far were under the management of the Americans.
There used to be a pretense that, when the Zionists would launch a military attack on Gaza, the Americans would then call for restraint. But now the Americans resisted and rejected Russia’s draft resolution that called for a ceasefire, as the British, and the French also did. They didn’t vote for it.
Well, these are the points, showing that the American diplomats have received certain orders to resist reducing violence or brokering a ceasefire and not talk about them. The close relationship between these two is now becoming evident. The disregard for human rights, which as you know, more than a thousand children were martyred in Gaza today as we speak. They were martyred with American weapons, American order, American plan, and in the American command room. And the American human rights has now taken on a new meaning.
And the hostility of the Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, toward the Islamic Republic also goes back to this reality. Because there is basically no difference when it comes to objectives. In terms of tactics, there may be a difference between, say, Netanyahu or some American official. However, there is no difference in terms of goals.
And finally, in my opinion, the weaknesses that we are witnessing in the US administration now – the physical weakness of Biden, the weakness of Biden’s government, the US involvement in Ukraine, and the conflict it has with China – are making the situation more difficult for the US. The Americans used to be a great power, and they did not have serious problems like those of today.
And one of the reasons behind the victory of the Resistance front is these weaknesses and their use of the existing weaknesses. We have now entered the election period in the US. Next year, we will have presidential elections in the US. The American political structure, which is shaped by influence and money of the one percent of the society, who are the Zionists, ultimately does not leave a choice for Biden and Biden’s administration.
The Resistance forces should continue doing what they have been doing so far, even though these are tough incidents – the martyrdom of people, the problems created for the general public and so on. They are all tough to overcome. However, they are an opportunity to understand the true nature of the American regime and the Zionist regime, and if this understanding does not happen now, I think a great opportunity would be lost.
