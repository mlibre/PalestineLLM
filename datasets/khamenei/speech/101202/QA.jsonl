{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did Palestine come to be occupied according to the text?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to the text, Palestine came to be occupied through a historical process consisting of tens of initiatives by the enemy. A number of globally influential Jews started to think of establishing an independent state for Jews. They initially considered Uganda and Tripoli, but eventually made a deal with the English, who had important colonialist ambitions for the Middle East at that time. The English realized that the settlement of Jews in the Middle East was in their best interest. The occupation of Palestinian lands was based on a multilateral, complex plan designed to prevent Muslim unity and the reestablishment of powerful Muslim governments. The text states that the Zionists had close relations with the Nazis, and exaggerated figures about massacred Jews were used to attract global sympathy and prepare the ground for occupying Palestine. Some evidence suggests that non-Jewish thugs from Eastern Europe were sent to Palestine as Jews to establish an anti-Islamic government at the heart of the Islamic world. The Ottoman Empire was defeated, and the Sykes-Picot Agreement was signed to carve up Muslim countries in the Middle East. The international community gave Palestine's custody to the English, who promised to help the Zionists. The English brought Jews to Palestine with well-thought-out plans and displaced Muslims from their homes."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What were the three foundations of the Zionists' illegitimate domination over Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to the text, the illegitimate domination of the Zionists over Palestine was based on three foundations:\n\n1. Being cruel to Arabs: They treated the real owners of Palestinian lands violently and ruthlessly, showing no signs of leniency.\n\n2. Manipulating public opinion: Both before and after occupying Palestine, they told many lies through Zionist media. They managed to deceive some people, including intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre. They pretended Palestine was a derelict and poor land that they made thrive, and always tried to play the part of the oppressed people.\n\n3. Collusion with others, or what they call \"lobbying\": They negotiated and colluded with different governments, individuals, politicians, intellectuals, authors, and poets. \n\nThe text states that their work has so far been based on these three foundations, and they have managed to occupy Palestine relying on these machinations. Moreover, foreign powers, especially England, assisted them in the process. They also enjoyed the support of the League of Nations and subsequently the United Nations, except in a few rare cases."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does the text say about the importance of the issue of Palestine for Muslims?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text emphasizes that the issue of Palestine is of paramount importance for Muslims. It states:\n\n1. In Muslim life and across the world of Islam, nothing is as important and serious as the issue of Palestine.\n\n2. The issue of Palestine is the most important international issue of Islam.\n\n3. It is not just a matter of Muslim homes being occupied; the problem is much more serious. The enemies of Islam throughout the world are using a Muslim territory to attack the ranks of Muslims and thwart their wishes and activities.\n\n4. It is a matter of establishing a malignant tumor at the heart of Islamic countries, at the point where the western and eastern parts of the world of Islam are connected.\n\n5. It is a matter of relentless oppression imposed on two consecutive generations of the Palestinian people.\n\n6. The text states that all Muslims and Arabs must voice their support for the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's battle.\n\n7. It is described as a religious duty for all Muslims to support the oppressed Palestinian people and their valiant uprising.\n\n8. The text argues that if Muslims were united today and relied on the spirituality of Islam, the enemy could not openly persecute and torture the Palestinian nation in its own homeland.\n\n9. It is mentioned that there is no disagreement among any of the major Islamic denominations and Islamic jurisprudents that if a single part of Muslim territories is conquered and ruled by the enemies of Islam, all Muslims must consider it their duty to make selfless efforts to restore that territory.\n\nThe text portrays the issue of Palestine as central to Islamic unity, identity, and religious obligation."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the text describe Imam Khomeini's stance on the issue of Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text describes Imam Khomeini's stance on the issue of Palestine as follows:\n\n1. From the beginning of the Islamic movement in Iran in 1341 (1962), when the issue of Palestine was not commonly discussed even by intellectuals, Imam Khomeini always emphasized that everyone should be alarmed by Israeli domination and that everyone should stand up to them.\n\n2. He continued this path later on, and the issue of Palestine became one of the main slogans shouted by that divine person.\n\n3. The movement started by Imam Khomeini revived the issue of Palestine and provided it with the support of Islamic faith, which has always been accompanied by selfless jihad.\n\n4. Imam Khomeini never gave up his support for the oppressed people across the world because of any considerations for global bullies. He continued to describe the issue of Palestine as the main issue.\n\n5. In his speeches and testament, Imam Khomeini explicitly expressed the importance he placed on Muslims' cries for help. He unambiguously defended the rights of the oppressed, the Palestinian nation, and all other oppressed nations.\n\n6. The text mentions that Imam Khomeini said, \"Israel must disappear.\"\n\n7. It is noted that even Palestinians imprisoned in occupied lands compose poems inspired by the magnanimous father of the Islamic Revolution.\n\n8. The memory of the Imam, the Revolution, and the selfless efforts of the Iranian nation are said to be found even inside the cells of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe text portrays Imam Khomeini as a consistent, strong, and influential supporter of the Palestinian cause, making it a central issue in his ideology and the Islamic Revolution in Iran."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What solution does the text propose for the issue of Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text proposes a specific solution for the issue of Palestine, which it describes as the logical and fair solution. The main points of this proposed solution are:\n\n1. Hold a referendum among the people of Palestine, including all those who have been displaced from Palestine and are willing to return to their homeland.\n\n2. The referendum should include all those who used to live in Palestine before 1948 (the year the Israeli government was established), including Muslims, Christians, and Jews.\n\n3. These people should be allowed to determine the government of Palestine through this referendum.\n\n4. The text argues that this solution respects democracy, human rights, and is consistent with the current logic of the world.\n\n5. Once the elected government is established, it can decide the fate of those who settled in Palestine after 1948. If the elected government decides the newcomers should stay, they can stay in Palestine. If it decides they should leave, they should leave Palestine.\n\n6. The text emphasizes that this solution is practical, citing examples of other regions that gained independence after long periods of occupation, such as the Baltic States and countries in the Caucasus region.\n\n7. It states that this solution requires courage and determination, and that nations are courageous, fearless, and prepared.\n\n8. The text argues against negotiating with the \"usurping\" regime, stating that Israel has proven it is not committed to any agreements.\n\n9. It calls on Arab governments, Islamic governments, international communities, and Islamic nations throughout the world, especially the Palestinian nation, to consider themselves responsible for persistently following up on this logical solution and putting it into practice.\n\nThe text presents this referendum-based solution as the only fair and democratic way to resolve the Palestinian issue, contrasting it with what it describes as failed negotiation attempts and unjust occupation."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the text describe the role of resistance in the Palestinian struggle?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text strongly emphasizes the crucial role of resistance in the Palestinian struggle. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Resistance is described as the only way to save Palestine. The text states, \"It is not possible to save Palestine through begging the United Nations and the domineering powers, or the Zionist regime for that matter. The only way to save Palestine is to resist.\"\n\n2. The text argues that Palestinian unity and monotheism are the inexhaustible driving forces behind all jihads.\n\n3. The foundations of this resistance are said to rest on Palestinian jihad groups, all faithful and steadfast Palestinians living inside and outside Palestine, as well as Muslim nations and governments throughout the world.\n\n4. The resistance and patience of the Palestinian people, along with full support from Islamic countries, are seen as the means to break the \"satanic spell of occupation over Palestine.\"\n\n5. The text praises the al-Aqsa Intifada as marking a new beginning for great developments in the resistance of the Palestinian people.\n\n6. It states that Palestinians have realized that continual jihad and resistance is the only way to liberate Palestine from the \"clutches of the Zionist criminals and their supporters.\"\n\n7. The text claims that resistance could, for the first time, liberate occupied lands without making any concessions to Israel, citing the example of Lebanon.\n\n8. It portrays the Palestinian nation as an oppressed but highly courageous nation, resisting single-handedly and fighting with their bare hands against materialistic powers with all means of suppression.\n\n9. The text argues that each selfless Palestinian youth who stands up to the occupying Zionists threatens them like an army, and that it's not possible to confront such people with conventional military means.\n\n10. It emphasizes that Palestinians' enthusiasm for martyrdom is not based on emotions, but on faith in Islam, Judgment Day, and life after death.\n\nOverall, the text presents resistance as the only effective and legitimate means for Palestinians to reclaim their rights and liberate their land, rejecting negotiations and compromise as ineffective and harmful to the Palestinian cause."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does the text say about the use of oil as a weapon in support of Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text discusses the use of oil as a weapon in support of Palestine, presenting it as a potentially powerful tool for Arab governments. Here are the key points:\n\n1. The text argues that one of the most important things Arab governments can do as oil exporters is to use oil more appropriately.\n\n2. It refutes Western claims against using oil as a weapon, stating that these claims are not true.\n\n3. The text asserts that oil belongs to nations, and they should use it to further their interests.\n\n4. It draws a parallel with American actions, stating that Americans have used wheat and foodstuff as a weapon in the past and are still doing so in many parts of the world.\n\n5. The text questions why Islamic and Arab countries should be deprived of this right to use their resources strategically.\n\n6. It suggests that as a symbolic act and a sign of support for the Palestinian nation, Arab countries should stop exporting oil to all countries that have good relations with Israel.\n\n7. The text emphasizes the dependence of the world on energy from Islamic countries, stating that the world gets its energy, electricity, heat, and the driving force for its factories from these countries.\n\n8. It argues that without oil, factories, lights, and heating systems in these countries would stop functioning.\n\n9. The text presents this as a powerful leverage that Arab oil-producing countries could use to pressure countries supporting Israel and to show support for the Palestinian cause.\n\nOverall, the text advocates for the strategic use of oil exports as an economic and political tool to support the Palestinian cause and pressure countries that support Israel."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the text describe the role of the United States in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text presents a highly critical view of the United States' role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Here are the key points:\n\n1. The U.S. is described as the patron of the Zionists, providing unconditional support to Israel.\n\n2. The text states that the American regime is responsible for a large portion of the Zionists' crimes.\n\n3. It accuses America of vetoing all UN Security Council resolutions against Israel. The text claims that during the decades of Israel's rule over Palestine, more than 30 resolutions have been passed by the UN Security Council against Israel, but America has vetoed all of these resolutions.\n\n4. The text argues that America and some other Western countries, as well as those who claim to be responsible for promoting democracy in the world, have disgraced themselves in the case of Palestine.\n\n5. It states that America calls Palestinian struggle for rights \"terrorism,\" but does not consider Zionist brutality against Palestinians as terrorism.\n\n6. The text accuses America and the arrogant powers of being unable to engage in the issues of Muslim countries as benevolent and sympathetic mediators. Instead, their role is described as that of an enemy, a supporter of oppressors and aggressors.\n\n7. It claims that America and the arrogant powers do not know that there is a force far more effective than their weapons - the power of people.\n\n8. The text suggests that any government supported by its people will not fear America and will not need to be considerate towards America.\n\n9. It accuses American politicians, along with global Zionism, of wrongly thinking they can defeat the Palestinian nation through brutal actions.\n\nOverall, the text portrays the United States as a biased, unjust supporter of Israel, actively hindering Palestinian rights and supporting what it describes as Zionist aggression and occupation. The U.S. is presented as an obstacle to justice for Palestinians and a major factor in the continuation of the conflict."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does the text say about the fate of Palestine and Israel?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text presents a clear and definitive view on the fate of Palestine and Israel:\n\n1. It asserts that Palestine and the Palestinian nation will survive, while the Zionists will disappear from the face of the earth and from history.\n\n2. The text states that the leaders of the \"usurping Zionist regime\" and their American supporters are trying to erase the name of Palestine from history and from people's minds, but they have not managed to achieve this goal and will not be able to do so.\n\n3. It claims that Zionism and the \"fake usurping Zionist regime\" in Palestine are doomed to annihilation.\n\n4. The text argues that sooner or later, the \"usurpers\" will inevitably surrender to the reality that Palestine belongs to the Palestinian nation.\n\n5. It predicts that through the continuation of resistance by the faithful Palestinian people and the support of the Islamic world, Palestine will be liberated.\n\n6. The text envisions that al-Quds (Jerusalem), Masjid al-Aqsa, and other parts of the occupied Islamic lands will be restored to the Islamic world.\n\n7. It states that the Palestinian nation has proven through its resistance that \"blood can stand up to the sword\" and predicts that the Palestinian nation will prove that \"blood can defeat the sword.\"\n\n8. The text describes the current conditions in Palestine as indicative of a \"definite future\" that Allah has promised for sincere and determined mujahids (fighters), and claims this divine promise is inviolable.\n\n9. It asserts that those who think they can defeat or force the Palestinian nation to surrender are making a fatal mistake and will be severely punished in the future.\n\n10. The text encourages Palestinian youth to rely on divine assistance and God's inviolable promises, stating that through their hope, faith, and selfless efforts, they should ensure a bright future for their nation.\n\nIn summary, the text predicts the eventual victory of the Palestinian cause, the liberation of Palestine, and the disappearance of the Israeli state, presenting this as an inevitable, divinely ordained outcome."}]}

He describes how the Ottoman Empire was defeated, the Sykes-Picot Agreement carved up Muslim countries, and England brought Jews to Palestine with well-thought-out plans, displacing Muslims from their homes."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does Khamenei say about the initial Zionist settlement strategy in Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to Khamenei, the initial Zionist settlement strategy in Palestine involved sending Jews as a minority group at first, and then gradually having them seize control of strategic regions to establish a government. He states: 'The plan was to send the Jews [to the Middle East] as a minority group in the beginning, and let them gradually seize control of some strategic regions and establish a government.' Khamenei claims this was part of a plan for the Jews to be allies of England and prevent the Islamic world, especially Arab states, from forming an alliance. He says the Zionists formed alliances with certain states and aggressively attacked others, benefiting from the support of England and Western countries initially, before later aligning with America."}]}

They started with deception, not through war.\n2. They bought large stretches of fertile Palestinian farmland from landlords living in Europe and America.\n3. They paid several times more than the real price of the lands.\n4. Landlords happily sold their lands to the Jews.\n5. There were middlemen involved, including allegedly Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee.\n6. Once the Jews bought the lands, they ruthlessly started driving farmers out.\n7. They used beatings and killings to remove the farmers.\n8. Simultaneously, they attracted global sympathy through deception and lies.\n\nKhamenei states: 'They did not start their occupation of Palestine through war. They started with deception. They bought large stretches of fertile Palestinian farmland from landlords who were living in Europe and America. They paid the landlords several times more than the real price of their lands, and the landlords happily sold their lands to the Jews.'"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does Khamenei characterize the portrayal of Jews and Arabs in global media during the occupation of Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Khamenei characterizes the portrayal of Jews and Arabs in global media during the occupation of Palestine as a complete reversal of reality. He states:\n\n'Reality stood on its head. In publicity campaigns throughout the world, many efforts have been made to portray the Jews who occupied Palestine as oppressed people whose rights had been trampled upon. On the other hand, the Arabs who have been trying to reclaim their homes are presented as bullying and violent people who are not committed to any ethical standards.'\n\nHe further elaborates that the Zionists and Russian Jews did not tell the world through their media that:\n1. They were usurpers\n2. The immigrants were not from Palestine\n3. The immigrants were from Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and America\n4. They were going to violate Palestinians' rights, occupy their homes, usurp their wealth and homeland, and deprive them of the opportunity to start a family\n\nInstead, Khamenei claims that Zionist and American agents were showing pictures of worn-out Jewish women and children to make the world wonder why the Arabs were treating the poor Jewish people so badly. This, he argues, was a deliberate misrepresentation of the situation to gain global sympathy for the Jewish settlers while demonizing the Arab inhabitants."}]}

Cruelty to Arabs: 'Being cruel to Arabs was the first foundation. They treated the real owners of Palestinian lands violently and ruthlessly. They did not show any signs of leniency in this regard.'\n\n2. Manipulating public opinion: 'Manipulating public opinion was the second foundation. Both before and after occupying Palestine, they told so many lies through Zionist media that some Zionist capitalists were arrested for spreading lies!' He mentions how they deceived even intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre with false narratives about Palestine being 'a land without a people for a people without a land.'\n\n3. Lobbying and collusion: 'The third foundation was to collude with others or what they call \"lobbying\". They negotiate and collude with different governments, individuals, politicians, intellectuals, authors, and poets.'\n\nKhamenei states that their work has been based on these three foundations, and they have managed to occupy Palestine relying on these machinations, with the assistance of foreign powers, especially England, and the support of international organizations like the League of Nations and the United Nations."}]}

Early emphasis: 'From the beginning of the Islamic movement in the country in 1341, when the issue of Palestine was not commonly discussed even by intellectuals, Imam Khomeini always emphasized that everyone should be alarmed by the Israeli domination and that everyone should stand up to them.'\n\n2.

Central to his legacy: 'In his speeches and testament, Imam Khomeini explicitly expressed the importance he placed on Muslims' cries for help.

Defending Palestinian rights: 'In international gatherings, it must be stressed that the defenseless people of Palestine whose rights have been violated are entitled to fight for their lost rights.'\n\n5. Supporting resistance: 'Therefore, continuation of Intifada and resistance is the absolute right of the Palestinian people, and international laws must respect this right.'\n\n6.

Providing defense means: 'Islamic governments are expected to provide the necessary means for the Palestine nation to defend itself.'\n\n2. Exerting political pressure: 'They are also expected to politically pressure those who support the Zionists' interests throughout the world.'\n\n3.

Using oil as leverage: 'As oil exporters, one of the most important things that Arab governments can do is to use oil more appropriately.'

Financial support: Khamenei implies that Islamic governments should provide financial assistance to Palestinians, stating 'Today the people of Palestine are in need of food and medicine.'\n\n6.

Mobilizing public support: 'Today Arab governments can take action and drum up support from their nations and increase their popularity in the issue of Palestine.'\n\n8. Standing firm against external pressures: 'If a government is supported by its people, then America cannot do anything to harm it. Such a government will not fear America, and it will not need to be considerate towards America.'\n\nKhamenei criticizes some Arab governments for their perceived inaction or betrayal, stating: 'The silence of most Arab rulers, which was in some cases accompanied by open treachery, and the disgraceful and treacherous positions adopted by the \"leaders of Palestine\" are the links in the chain of oppression, transgression, and treachery that is being used to shackle the oppressed people of Palestine.'"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is Khamenei's view on using oil as a political tool in support of Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Khamenei strongly advocates for using oil as a political tool to support Palestine. His view on this matter can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Legitimate right: 'What westerners are saying against using oil as a weapon is not true. Oil belongs to nations, and they should use it to further their interests.'\n\n2. Precedent set by other countries: 'Americans also used wheat and foodstuff as a weapon in the past, and they are still doing so in many parts of the world. Why should Islamic and Arab countries be deprived of this right?'\n\n3. Symbolic action: 'As a symbolic act and as a sign of support for the Palestinian nation, they should stop exporting oil to all the countries that have good relations with Israel.'\n\n4. Leverage: Khamenei emphasizes the dependence of the world on oil from Islamic countries, stating, 'Today the world is getting its energy, electricity, heat, and the driving force for its factories from Islamic countries. These are the essential elements of their life. If they do not get oil, their factories, lights, and heating systems will stop functioning.'\n\n5. Powerful tool: He sees oil as one of the most important tools at the disposal of Arab governments to support Palestine, especially for oil-exporting nations.\n\n6. Call to action: Khamenei urges Arab governments, particularly oil-producing states, to use this resource strategically in support of the Palestinian cause.\n\nIn essence, Khamenei views the strategic use of oil exports as a legitimate and potentially powerful means for Islamic and Arab countries to exert pressure on nations supporting Israel and to show solidarity with Palestine."}]}
