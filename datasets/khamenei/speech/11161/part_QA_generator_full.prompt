Speech Date: Oct 2, 2024
Title: If the villainy of US & some European countries is removed from this region, these wars will be eliminated
The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Imam Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, in a meeting with hundreds of the academic elites, top participants in the Olympiads, and outstanding scientific talents. The meeting took place in the Imam Khomeini Hussainiyah on October 2, 2024.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful
All praise is due to God, Lord of the Worlds, and may peace and greetings be upon our Master and our Prophet, Abul-Qasim al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his untainted, pure, chosen Progeny, particularly the Remnant of God on earth.
Welcome! It is a great pleasure for me and I am very happy to meet this dear, valuable group. Before I begin, I would like to say a few words about what has been said. Well, some very good matters were discussed, first by Dr. Afshin regarding the work he plans to do and his future programs. It makes one happy and hopeful. In addition, the comments, discussions, research, and suggestions that were shared by our dear brothers and sisters here merit consideration, attention, and follow-up. Now that these things have been said, I would like to discuss two things here today.
Regarding the remarks made by the honorable Vice President [for Science and Technology], praise God, you enjoy the blessing of youth. One of the characteristics of youth is that one’s mind becomes active. It works and sets great goals in the sky, in the air, and in the first, second, and third heavens, which is a good thing. I have no doubt about the goodness of this behavior. However, there is a lack in what we are doing. We have plenty of plans, programs, policies, and proposals on various issues — the same issues that our friends mentioned. What we lack is “follow-up.” We don’t follow things up enough.
A person in charge makes a decision and gives an order to his deputy who says, "Yes, sir." The deputy then gives an order to the director, who also says, "Yes, sir." After a year, neither the person in charge asks the deputy about the progress, nor does the deputy ask the director. As a result, the work doesn’t get done. The points you've made are excellent. I agree with them 100 percent and am delighted to hear them. However, you need to follow things through. These matters require follow-up. Find out how you can implement and achieve these things. This is one matter.
The second matter concerns the statements made by these young people who came here to speak. Well, seven of the country’s top talents came here and spoke about various subjects. This is not a small matter. They discussed a range of issues, ranging from industry and economics to the humanities, and so on. What should we do in response? What should we do and how should we respond to the statements made by these esteemed individuals?
What I want to say is that I suggest you consider these words. Some of the proposals may be impractical, which is true. Some opinions and suggestions are impractical, but many of them are actually practical. In the position of being the Vice President, see which government or non-governmental organizations these suggestions pertain to. The Vice Presidency has significant authority, and I recommend you seek the assistance of the President himself too. Ask for this from that organization.
For example, the issue of Makran was brought up, and there was a suggestion for it as well. Very well, who should implement this suggestion? Which organization is it related to? Find that out, consult the one who made this suggestion, and then follow up on it to ensure that it is carried out. Otherwise, merely talking about good ideas and listening to good words won’t get anything done. That’s what I wanted to say.
I would like to thank our friends here from the bottom of my heart for their well-considered, good words. We are mourning these days. I am deeply grieved in particular. The tragedy which took place was not something small. The loss of Mr. Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah is very important, and it truly grieves us. Even though the atmosphere in the country is one of mourning and it truly is a time of grief, I chose to not postpone this meeting. This meeting had been planned from before. We could have postponed it to next week, for example, but I didn’t do that. I thought it’s not right to delay this meeting.
This orientation, the orientation toward talented individuals and the pursuit of excellence must not be delayed. So we are holding this meeting. Holding this meeting has a message for us. The message is that even though we are in mourning, this doesn’t mean that we should just sit in a corner and wallow in despair. Our mourning is of the same nature as that of mourning for Imam Hussain (pbuh). It is alive and revives us. We are grieving, but this grief propels us to move forward, to make progress, and to work with even more enthusiasm. I want us to truly internalize this message in our hearts and souls. We should understand that our mourning must help us to move forward too. Of course, I have some things to say regarding the issues in Lebanon and matters that are related to our distinguished dear martyr [Sayyid Hassan Nasrallah]. I will discuss these in the near future, God willing.
Regarding the topic of the academic elite, I have chosen three points, and I will briefly discuss each one of them. One point is to pay attention to the reality of outstanding talent in the country. That is, what is the state of our country in terms of its academic elite and their situation? Are the things that we or some others say an exaggeration, or not? This is one point.
The reason I’m bringing this up is that some people still deny the competency and abilities of Iranians, just as they did some 90 or 100 years ago. They either ignore this talent or deny it. There are still people in our country who refuse to acknowledge that in the current atmosphere and ecosystem of our country, significant events may take place that could be new and novel for the world as well. There are still some who don’t believe this. I would like to say a few words about this.
The second point concerns strategies for preserving, multiplying, and enhancing the effectiveness of our academic elite. What measures can we implement to ensure that the presence of a talented person is effective, fosters the emergence of more talented people, and helps to keep the academic elite as elites? I have noted a few short sentences on this topic that I will be sharing with you. The third point concerns the responsibilities of the academic elite. After all, you are talented individuals and have certain responsibilities. These responsibilities should be stated, even though talented people typically understand their own duties.
When it comes to the reality of our [country’s] outstanding talent, my point is that we need to recognize and understand the value of our country and the intellectual and cognitive capabilities that lead to [one’s] outstanding talent. We need to identify this potential. One of the worst afflictions for an individual, a group, or a nation is them not recognizing their own assets.
Our adversaries, the enemies of this country, try to hide or deny our assets. We must not accept or tolerate their attempts. Instead, we should strive to recognize our country’s assets. One of our most important assets is our talented individuals and the background that fosters their growth. This background primarily consists of natural factors, followed by social, contractual, organizational, and similar factors.
I believe that the most important aspect of an outstanding talent is “IQ.” When it comes to IQ, our country is among the world’s highest. Iran is among the leading nations in the world [in this area.] I have received a report that all of you have probably seen as well. It is a report from an international center specifically dedicated to measuring the IQ of different nations. They estimate the average IQ of different nations around the world on a regular basis. This report is the updated version for the year 2024, as noted in the information I’ve received.
Iran ranks third among the 23 countries that I saw in this list. Perhaps they have assessed over 200 countries in the world. [But] this report that I’ve received, cites the top 23 countries in the world. After Iran comes Japan, then Singapore, followed by other countries like Canada, Germany, Italy, and France. France ranks 19th on the list, the UK ranks 21st, and India is 23rd. We are in third place on this list. This is a very important, noteworthy phenomenon. It shows the average IQ of the Iranian nation.
I mentioned that the most important factor and capacity needed for the growth of the intellectual elite is a person’s intelligence quotient. Of course, a person’s IQ must be activated and put into action. We need to provide the necessary background for this. Those things must also be present. Well, this is a tremendous asset. The fact that the average IQ in our country is so high is no small matter. It is an enormous wealth, an extraordinary human resource. Human resources surpass everything else we have in the country [as our greatest asset], including minerals, resources, geographical position, and so on
Of course, no attention was given whatsoever to the issue of outstanding talent and the cultivation of the intellectual elite before the Revolution. The focus was on other matters. The issue of talented individuals and the intellectual and mental elite was not addressed. This endeavor began after the Revolution. In the very early years of the Revolution when the youth were given the opportunity to enter various fields, I had gone to the south [of Iran]. I think it may have been in 1980 or 1981. The youth in the newly formed Jihad of Construction had built a silo there. It was a small silo, of course. The construction of silos apparently involves complex technology.
They told me that they could build silos in a number sufficient for the country's wheat capacity. The young people boldly made this assertion. The youth entered the field, were given the opportunity, and have now reached a level where they are doing much more important work than just building silos, both in Jihad [of Construction] and in other areas. After the Revolution, attention was paid to the abilities of the young intellectual elite in the country. However, this is not being done to the extent that it should be in the country. More work needs to be done in this area.
These things that you have spoken of here are needed in many fields. You mentioned the issue of water. In issues relating to oil, gas, nuclear energy, nanotechnology, new sciences such as artificial intelligence, and various other sciences we need the same spirit, the same action, the same initiative, the same ability, knowledge, and follow-up. We must involve the intellectual elite. This is an important step. In my opinion, this is one of the tasks that the Vice President for Science and Technology can undertake. The establishment of the National Elites Foundation, a proposal which was fortunately accepted years ago by the officials, was essentially aimed at identifying the nation’s top talent and involving them in important tasks. This is the first point, which is realizing the reality of our country's outstanding talent.
In the area of preserving and increasing the number of the academic elite, I say that in order to keep the academic elite as elites, to ensure that the country can benefit from them, and also to prevent them from thinking about leaving and departing the country with unrealistic hopes, certain actions need to be taken. The most important thing is that these talented individuals should sense that their presence has an impact on the country. That’s what the academic elite are after. The academic elite, especially the young academic elite, want their intellectual and scientific achievements to be used by the country.
When talented individuals go to the university, they are faced with closed doors. The same thing happens when they go to certain research institutes and government organizations. Even if these academic elite remain in the country, they will no longer be one of the academic elite. They will seek some other work. One of these talented individuals may even end up working as a taxi driver in order to earn a living. We mustn’t allow these academic elite to feel that they have no effect. They need to feel that they're making a difference.
Consider, for example, a brilliant physicist or mathematician today who wants to be useful. Where should they go? They have completed their studies and are now considered to be one of the academic elite. In our country, who should an elite mathematician approach to ensure their knowledge, expertise, and intellect benefit the nation? Personally, I believe the Vice President for Science and Technology can be the connecting link for this as well, and it would be good for him to pay attention to this issue and pursue it. Therefore, the first point is that the entire system — the administration and other governing bodies — must strive to make use of the academic elite so that they will feel that their presence is useful.
The second point is that the academic elite need to feel like they can continue to grow. Many of our youth have already reached high levels of academic achievement, but this doesn’t satisfy them. They want to research, grow, and acquire more knowledge. Many of the academic elite who leave the country leave to pursue this goal. This should not be interpreted as them turning their backs on the country. They simply believe, regardless of whether or not this belief is true, that they will have more opportunities for research and learning in another country.
We need to provide them with the tools they need here. This necessitates [building] laboratories, big workshops, and creating strong connections with industry, agriculture, and mining. For example, a student who has studied agriculture may have suggestions regarding water efficiency, efficiency in seed [distribution], and other similar topics. They should know that these ideas can be used here. This can be facilitated by collaborating with universities, industries, and so on. They may propose very important projects. Therefore, another issue is to find ways to provide research facilities and ways for advancing knowledge.
Another important place where the intellectual elite can become involved is in the establishment of think tanks. Of course, this isn’t possible without government assistance and support in our country at this time. While this may change in the future, government assistance is essential for now if we want to have active think tanks. These think tanks will be gatherings of the intellectual elite from every field, and this will encourage and motivate them to be more active.
I again believe the Vice President for Science and Technology should serve as a connecting link between these think tanks and relevant organizations. However, we need to cut through the red tape. We have a lot of bureaucracy and paperwork in various areas. In some places, it is harmful but not fatal. Regarding the delicate nature of the intellectual elite, this bureaucracy is fatal. Keeping them waiting behind closed doors discourages them completely. This is another point. In my opinion, the respected Vice President for Science and Technology should make the best use of this vast pool of talented human resources.
The third topic is regarding the duties of the elite. First of all, the intellectual elite are “responsible.” An elite is like every other member in society. “All of you are like shepherds, and each of you is responsible for your flock” (Manyat al-Murid, 381). Wherever you are, you are responsible. Now, one of those who are responsible in society is the intellectual elite. The responsibilities of the intellectual elite are greater than that of the average person. Why? Because they have benefited more from God’s blessings.
The more you benefit from divine favors, the greater your responsibilities become [because] you gain power, honor, knowledge, and wealth, all of which are divine favors, "Whatever blessing you have is from God" (Quran 16:53). All of these come from God, thus they increase responsibility. Therefore, the first point to consider is the matter of the responsibility of the intellectual elite.
Second, there is an important task in the country today, and that is a new scientific leap. A few years ago, we saw that the matter of science, the pursuit of knowledge, and crossing the frontiers of knowledge was raised and this was well-received. Institutions, universities, and scientists pursued this matter and this was influential. They said that the rate of scientific growth in the country is about 13 times higher than the global average. This is very important. The pace of our [scientific] advancement is incredible. But even then, I cautioned against becoming complacent with these statistics because we are so far behind. We need to maintain that same pace.
Well, it declined a bit and wasn’t kept up in the same manner. Science is developing very rapidly in the world. You are all academics. You see how rapidly scientific developments are taking place. We need a new leap forward. We need a new movement. We need a new scientific movement. Who’s going to do this? You, the academic elite. Of course, universities have a duty. Various scientific centers, research institutes, and similar organizations also have duties, but the main driving force [behind this change] is with you, the academic elite. Pursue scientific advancement. This is your jihad. Of course, I’m not stopping you from engaging in other forms of jihad, such as financial jihad, the jihad of clarification, and so on. However, the main jihad for you, the academic elite, is this scientific movement, this new scientific leap forward, and obtaining scientific superiority over rivals and ill-wishers.
We must achieve scientific superiority because we have enemies. There are reasons for this that are not relevant to this discussion. That is, all countries and all nations have rivals, ill-wishers, and enemies, and we have more of these than many other countries. We must overcome them with scientific superiority. As in some examples, if we have achieved dominance in certain areas, it has been due to our scientific and technological superiority.
I have noted here that scientific and technological superiority can sometimes prevent the enemy from striking large populations like they’re doing in Gaza and Dahieh. If, for example, we were more scientifically advanced in the field of weaponry than we are now, it would certainly have affected the situation in the region and could have prevented or extinguished these burning fires in people's hearts and souls. Scientific progress and superiority are effective in this way as well.
My next urgent recommendation to our intellectual elite is the “establishment of knowledge-based companies.” The number of such companies anticipated by the end of the [Seventh Development] Plan is 30,000, a target we have yet to reach. Of course, we must maintain high standards for what constitutes a knowledge-based company. We must be careful not to create companies that aren’t genuinely knowledge-based companies. They must be truly knowledge-based companies. While maintaining strict evaluation criteria, we must also increase the number of these companies. This is something that our intellectual elite need to do.
I have finished talking about what I wanted to say. As I mentioned, I will address issues concerning Gaza and Lebanon next, God willing. I will just say one more thing now, and that is that the root of the problem in our region — these conflicts, wars, worries, and animosities — is the presence of those who claim to advocate peace in the region. That is, the United States and some European countries. If the villainy of the US and certain European countries is removed from this region, undoubtedly these conflicts, wars, and confrontations will be completely eliminated. Then the countries in the region will be able to govern themselves and their region, and they will live together in peace, health, and prosperity.
One day, they provoke a country, they provoke someone like Saddam, and this causes the situation to become difficult and bitter (like during the Iran-Iraq war). Another day, he is no longer there and neither are his supporters. The friendship between the two countries becomes what you see during the Arbaeen Walk and what you have witnessed firsthand. That’s how it is. It’s the same with other countries. The very presence of those who are lying today when they speak of peace in the region are themselves the main cause of the problems in the region. We are hopeful that with God’s help, the hard effort of the Iranian people, inspiration drawn from the Islamic Revolution, and collaboration with other nations, we will remove our enemies from the region, God willing.
May God’s greetings, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
