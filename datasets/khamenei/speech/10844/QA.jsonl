It means not only enduring with patience, but also creating opportunities for oneself amidst adversities, initiating an epic movement, and obtaining sweet outcomes from bitter events."}]}

Imam Khamenei felt sorry for Mr. Raisi because some of these individuals were not willing to say even one of these things when he was alive. They witnessed his merits while he was alive, but they would hide this or even do the opposite and upset him."}]}

That is, they become defeated by the tragedy and lose hope. Another way to react when facing adversities is to stand firmly in confronting them. This concept is referred to as sabr [patience] in the Quran. Sabr entails standing firmly in the face of challenges and being patient. It means not only enduring with patience, but also creating opportunities for oneself amidst adversities, initiating an epic movement, and obtaining sweet outcomes from bitter events."}]}

These fervent gatherings conveyed several messages. One of them was that the Iranian people are motivated, tireless, resilient, alive, and they are present in the face of various events and demonstrate their determination. Another message was that a strong connection, affection, and an emotional bond exists between the people and the high-ranking officials of the country. This is exactly the opposite of what the enemy wishes to portray."}]}

The enemies continuously said this outside the country, and unfortunately some repeated this inside the country that 'The Islamic Republic has lost its national asset.' No, the [true] national asset of the Islamic Republic may be seen when a president is taken from the people and millions of people come out into the streets [for his funeral procession]. Nowhere in the world is there anything like this. Such a thing has never been witnessed anywhere else in the world."}]}

They [the enemies] cannot hide this. Because the late Mr. Raisi, may God be pleased with him, used to explicitly state the mottos of the Revolution, and he was the embodiment of the Revolution’s mottos. When the people honor and praise him, they are actually showing their own attachment to the mottos of the Revolution, because he was the embodiment of them."}]}

They affect the distribution of power in the region.

This reflects the realities of Iran and Iranians to the world."}]}

Therefore, these elections are very important. This electoral epic will serve to complete the epic farewell you gave to the martyrs."}]}
