{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What factors contributed to the birth of the Palestinian question?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The Palestinian question arose from a combination of several key factors during the early 20th century. These included:\n\n1. The fall of the Ottoman Empire: This created a power vacuum in the region and led to new political arrangements.\n\n2. The birth of the Zionist movement: This political ideology advocated for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\n3. The declaration of Palestine as a British mandate: This placed Palestine under British administration following World War I.\n\n4. British policies and preferential treatment: Even before the official mandate began in 1922, British policies tended to favor Zionist colonists, creating tensions with the native Palestinian population.\n\n5. Increased Zionist settlement: The British sponsorship provided cover for the Zionist movement to intensify its colonization efforts in Palestine.\n\nThese factors combined to create a volatile political climate in Palestine, setting the stage for the conflicts and displacements that would follow in the subsequent decades."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did British sponsorship affect Zionist colonization efforts in Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "British sponsorship had a significant impact on Zionist colonization efforts in Palestine. While Zionist settlement in Palestine predated the mandate years, the newly found British support provided crucial advantages:\n\n1. Political cover: British sponsorship, whether tacit or explicit, gave legitimacy to Zionist settlement activities.\n\n2. Increased immigration: British policies often facilitated increased Jewish immigration to Palestine.\n\n3. Land acquisition: The mandate government sometimes made it easier for Zionist organizations to purchase land.\n\n4. Proto-state development: Under British rule, the Jewish Yishuv (the pre-state Jewish community in Palestine) was able to develop into what was essentially a proto-state within Palestine. This included establishing separate institutions, economic systems, and even militias.\n\n5. Preferential treatment: British policies often favored Zionist settlers over the native Palestinian population, creating an environment conducive to Zionist expansion.\n\n6. International recognition: British support lent international credibility to the Zionist cause, as evidenced by documents like the Balfour Declaration.\n\nThis support allowed the Zionist movement to significantly ramp up its colonization efforts, laying the groundwork for the eventual establishment of a Jewish state. The British sponsorship thus played a crucial role in altering the demographic and political landscape of Palestine during the mandate period."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is meant by the 'logic of elimination' in the context of settler colonialism?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The 'logic of elimination' in the context of settler colonialism refers to a concept coined by scholar Patrick Wolfe. This concept describes the underlying rationale and practices employed by settler colonial movements to remove or erase the native population from the land they aim to colonize. In the context of Zionist settlement in Palestine, the 'logic of elimination' manifested in several ways:\n\n1. Moral justifications: Settlers develop ideological and moral arguments to justify the removal of the native population. These often involve claims of superiority, divine right, or the idea that the land is not being properly utilized by the natives.\n\n2. Practical means: This involves developing and implementing strategies to physically remove or marginalize the native population. These can range from forced displacement to more extreme measures like ethnic cleansing or genocide.\n\n3. Erasure of native identity: This includes efforts to deny or erase the existence, history, and rights of the native population. In the Palestinian context, this is seen in Zionist slogans like 'A land without a people for a people without a land' or claims that 'there is no such thing as a Palestinian.'\n\n4. Cultural suppression: Attempts to suppress or replace native culture, language, and traditions with those of the settler population.\n\n5. Economic dispossession: Policies and practices that deprive the native population of their land, resources, and means of livelihood.\n\n6. Legal and political structures: Establishing laws and governance systems that favor the settlers and disadvantage or exclude the native population.\n\nThe 'logic of elimination' is not unique to Zionist settler-colonialism but is a common feature of settler colonial movements worldwide. It represents a fundamental aspect of the settler colonial project, which seeks not just to rule over the native population (as in other forms of colonialism) but to replace them entirely, establishing a new society on the colonized land."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did Zionist talking points reflect the 'logic of elimination'?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Zionist talking points reflected the 'logic of elimination' in several ways, illustrating how settler colonial ideologies seek to justify and facilitate the removal or erasure of the native population. Some key examples include:\n\n1. 'A land without a people for a people without a land': This slogan effectively denied the existence of the Palestinian people, portraying Palestine as an empty land waiting to be settled. It erased the presence and rights of the native population, making their displacement seem less problematic.\n\n2. 'There is no such thing as a Palestinian': This direct denial of Palestinian identity and nationhood served to delegitimize Palestinian claims to the land. By arguing that Palestinians didn't exist as a distinct people, Zionists could more easily justify their displacement.\n\n3. 'Israel made the desert bloom': This claim implied that the land was not being properly utilized by its native inhabitants, and that only through Zionist settlement could it reach its full potential. It portrayed Palestinians as backward or incapable, thereby justifying their replacement by 'more advanced' settlers.\n\n4. Portrayal of Palestinians as 'disconnected communities' or 'wandering rootless vagabonds': By denying the cohesive nature of Palestinian society and their deep connection to the land, Zionists could more easily argue for their removal or relocation.\n\n5. Use of biblical arguments: Claims of a divine right to the land based on ancient biblical promises were used to supersede the rights of the current inhabitants.\n\n6. Emphasis on Jews as 'returning' to their homeland: This narrative framed Jewish settlement as a return rather than a colonization, implying that Palestinians were merely temporary occupants of the land.\n\nThese talking points served multiple purposes within the 'logic of elimination':\n\n- They provided moral justifications for the Zionist project.\n- They helped to erase or minimize the existence and rights of Palestinians.\n- They created a narrative that made the displacement of Palestinians seem necessary or even beneficial.\n- They appealed to Western audiences, garnering support for the Zionist cause.\n\nBy employing these rhetorical strategies, Zionist leaders and supporters could more easily pursue policies and actions that led to the displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian population, all while maintaining a sense of moral righteousness about their cause."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did the 'logic of elimination' in Zionist settler-colonialism compare to other colonial situations?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The 'logic of elimination' in Zionist settler-colonialism shared many similarities with other colonial situations around the world. Here's a comparison:\n\n1. Denial of native existence: Just as Zionists claimed 'a land without a people for a people without a land,' other colonial powers used similar arguments. For example, the concept of 'Terra Nullius' (nobody's land) was used by British colonists in Australia to justify their settlement, ignoring the presence of Aboriginal peoples.\n\n2. Portrayal of natives as uncivilized: Zionists often viewed Palestinians as inferior and uncivilized, similar to how European colonists viewed indigenous populations in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. This was used to justify the idea that the settlers would make better use of the land.\n\n3. Religious or ideological justification: Like Zionists using biblical arguments to claim a right to Palestine, other colonists often used religious or ideological arguments to justify their actions. For instance, the concept of 'Manifest Destiny' in the United States was used to justify westward expansion and the displacement of Native Americans.\n\n4. Economic arguments: The claim that 'Israel made the desert bloom' echoes arguments made by colonists in other parts of the world that they were improving the land and using resources more efficiently than the native population.\n\n5. Erasure of native identity: The denial of Palestinian identity ('there is no such thing as a Palestinian') is similar to how other colonial powers often tried to erase or delegitimize native identities, cultures, and histories.\n\n6. Creation of separate institutions: The development of the Jewish Yishuv as a proto-state within Palestine mirrors how other settler colonial societies often created parallel institutions that excluded the native population.\n\n7. Land appropriation: The systematic acquisition of land by Zionist organizations is similar to land grabs seen in other colonial contexts, such as in North America or South Africa.\n\n8. Population transfer: The idea of removing the native population, which culminated in the Nakba, has parallels in other colonial situations, such as the Trail of Tears in the United States or the forced relocations in Australia.\n\n9. Legal structures favoring settlers: The creation of laws and policies that favored Jewish immigrants over native Palestinians is similar to legal structures in other colonial settings that privileged settlers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while there are many similarities, each colonial situation also had its unique aspects based on specific historical, geographical, and cultural contexts. The Zionist colonial project in Palestine occurred later than many other colonial endeavors and in a different global political context, which influenced its development and international reception.\n\nDespite these differences, the underlying 'logic of elimination' remained consistent across various settler colonial projects, demonstrating how this logic is fundamental to the settler colonial mindset regardless of the specific time or place."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did Palestinians initially react to the arrival of Zionist settlers?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to the information provided, the initial reaction of Palestinians to the arrival of Zionist settlers was generally welcoming. The text states that there is 'ample evidence -recorded by the Zionist pioneers themselves- that the native Palestinian population was welcoming of the first Zionist settlers.' This positive initial reception included several aspects:\n\n1. Cooperation: Palestinians and Zionist settlers worked side by side in various capacities.\n\n2. Knowledge sharing: Palestinians taught the new arrivals how to work the land, sharing their agricultural expertise.\n\n3. Coexistence: There was an initial expectation of peaceful coexistence between the two communities.\n\nHowever, this welcoming attitude changed over time as the true intentions of the Zionist movement became clear. The shift occurred when Palestinians realized that:\n\n1. The settlers did not come to live in Palestine as equals, but rather to become its 'landlords,' as stated by Jewish National Fund Chairman Menachem Usishkin.\n\n2. The Zionist movement was not interested in coexistence, but rather in establishing an exclusive Jewish ethnocracy.\n\n3. Zionist leadership actively discouraged integration, going as far as sanctioning settlers who employed or worked with Palestinians.\n\n4. The Zionist trade union banned non-Jewish members, promoting segregation.\n\nAs a result of these revelations, Zionism came to be perceived as a threat by the Palestinian population. This led to resistance against both the British administrators and the Zionist settlers, exemplified by events such as the 1936 revolt.\n\nIt's important to note that this shift in attitude was not due to antisemitism, as some Zionist accusations claimed. British reports, such as the Haycraft report, concluded that Palestinian actions were motivated by the preferential treatment given to Zionist settlers by the British military administration, rather than by antisemitism."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What were some of the British reports that documented tensions between Palestinians and Zionist settlers?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text mentions several British reports that documented the tensions between Palestinians and Zionist settlers during the mandate period. These reports were part of the British colonial administration's efforts to monitor and understand the situation in Palestine. Here are the key reports mentioned:\n\n1. The Haycraft Report: This report investigated the causes of tensions between Palestinians and Zionist settlers. Its main conclusions were:\n   - The actions of Palestinians were not motivated by antisemitism, contrary to Zionist accusations.\n   - The root cause of tensions was the preferential treatment given to Zionist settlers by the British military administration, which was detrimental to the Palestinians.\n\n2. The Shaw Report: This report provided historical context to the tensions, stating that:\n   - There had been no significant tension between the communities for nearly a century prior to the British mandate and the intensification of Zionist settlement.\n   - The distrust between Palestinian and Zionist populations intensified after the establishment of the British military administration of Palestine and the issuance of the Balfour declaration.\n\nWhile not explicitly named in the text, the mention of 'report after report' suggests that there were likely other British investigations and documentations of the situation in Palestine. These reports collectively:\n\n- Were based on empirical data collected by the British as colonial overlords.\n- Attempted to monitor and understand the escalating tensions across Palestine.\n- Provided evidence that the conflict was not rooted in long-standing antisemitism, but rather in recent political developments and policies.\n- Highlighted the role of British policies, particularly the preferential treatment of Zionist settlers, in exacerbating tensions.\n- Documented the changing dynamics between the Palestinian and Zionist communities over time.\n\nThese reports serve as important historical documents, providing insight into the British perspective on the developing conflict in Palestine during the mandate years. They also challenge some of the narratives put forward by Zionist leadership about the nature and causes of the tensions in Palestine."}]}

Land Ownership:\n   - Despite extensive efforts by Zionist organizations to purchase land, they controlled only 5-6% of the land in mandatory Palestine.\n   - This means that the vast majority of the land (94-95%) was still owned by Palestinians or was state land.\n\n2. Population:\n   - The Zionist settlers constituted approximately one-third of the total population.\n   - This means that Palestinians still made up about two-thirds of the population.\n\n3. Settlement Pattern:\n   - The Zionist population did not amount to a clear majority in any region of Palestine.\n   - This population had only recently arrived, with the bulk coming during the 4th and 5th Zionist immigration waves (Aliyot) between 1924-1939.\n\n4. Implications:\n   - These demographics made it impossible to establish an exclusivist Zionist state in Palestine without significant displacement of the native Palestinian population.\n   - The recent arrival of the majority of the Zionist population (most having been there for 20 years or less) contrasted with the long-standing presence of the Palestinian population.\n\n5. Historical Context:\n   - This situation existed despite nearly three decades of British rule that often favored Zionist immigration and land acquisition.\n   - It also followed several waves of Zionist immigration and intensive efforts to purchase land.\n\nThis demographic and land ownership reality formed the backdrop against which proposals for partitioning Palestine into Arab-Palestinian and Zionist-Jewish states began to gain traction in some circles. It also highlights the significant changes that would need to occur for a Zionist state to be established with a Jewish majority, foreshadowing the events of the Nakba that would follow."}]}

It begins shortly after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and continues through the British Mandate period, culminating in the establishment of the state of Israel and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What factors contributed to the birth of the Palestinian question?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The Palestinian question emerged as a result of several interconnected factors during the early 20th century. These factors include:\n1.\nThe fall of the Ottoman Empire: This created a power vacuum in the region and opened the door for new political arrangements.\n2.\nThe birth of the Zionist movement: This political ideology aimed to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine, leading to increased Jewish immigration and land acquisition.\n3.\nThe declaration of Palestine as a British mandate: This gave Britain administrative control over the region and allowed them to implement policies that would significantly impact the local population.\n4.\nBritish policies and preferential treatment of Zionist colonists: Even before Palestine was officially declared a mandate in 1922, British actions helped create a volatile political climate by favoring Zionist settlers over the native Palestinian population.\n5.\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1917: This statement of British support for a 'national home for the Jewish people' in Palestine further legitimized Zionist aspirations and raised concerns among Palestinians.\n6.\nThe establishment of the Jewish Yishuv: This proto-state within Palestine, with British sponsorship, allowed for the ramping up of Zionist colonization efforts.\n7.\nThe 'logic of elimination': The Zionist goal of establishing an exclusive Jewish ethnocracy in a land already inhabited by Palestinians led to the development of justifications and means for removing the native population. These factors combined to create a situation where the rights and aspirations of the native Palestinian population were increasingly threatened, leading to resistance and conflict. The Palestinian question thus emerged as a complex issue involving competing national claims, colonial policies, and the rights of indigenous peoples versus immigrant settlers."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did the British mandate affect the political climate in Palestine?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The British mandate had a profound impact on the political climate in Palestine, creating and exacerbating tensions between the native Palestinian population and Zionist settlers. Here's how the mandate affected the situation:\n1.\nPreferential treatment: Even before Palestine was officially declared a mandate in 1922, British policies showed a clear preference for Zionist colonists. This favoritism created resentment among the Palestinian population and laid the groundwork for future conflicts.\n2.\nLegitimization of Zionist aspirations: The Balfour Declaration of 1917 and subsequent British policies provided official support for the establishment of a 'Jewish national home' in Palestine. This legitimized Zionist goals and encouraged increased Jewish immigration and land acquisition.\n3.\nCreation of a proto-state: The Jewish Yishuv, under British sponsorship, effectively became a state within a state. This allowed the Zionist movement to develop its own institutions, economy, and military capabilities, separate from the native Palestinian population.\n4.\nSuppression of Palestinian resistance: When Palestinians resisted Zionist colonization and British policies, the British authorities often responded with force. This further alienated the Palestinian population and increased tensions.\n5.\nLand policies: British land laws and policies often facilitated the transfer of land from Palestinian to Zionist ownership, contributing to Palestinian dispossession.\n6.\nImmigration policies: The British allowed significant Jewish immigration, particularly during times of crisis in Europe, which dramatically altered the demographic balance in Palestine.\n7.\nFailure to grant self-determination: Despite promises of eventual self-rule, the British failed to grant Palestinians the right to self-determination, frustrating Palestinian political aspirations.\n8.\nPartition plans: British-sponsored partition plans, which proposed dividing Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, were seen as favoring Zionist interests at the expense of Palestinian rights.\n9.\nMilitary presence: The British military administration's actions often exacerbated tensions, as noted in reports like the Haycraft report, which concluded that Palestinian actions were motivated by British favoritism towards Zionist settlers rather than antisemitism.\n10.\nRecord-keeping: As colonial overlords, the British kept detailed records of the growing tensions, providing documentation of the escalating conflict. These factors combined to create a highly volatile political climate characterized by increasing distrust between Palestinians and Zionist settlers, growing Palestinian resentment towards British rule, and an empowered Zionist movement with proto-state capabilities. This volatile situation ultimately led to the violent conflict and mass displacement of Palestinians known as the Nakba in 1948."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What was the 'logic of elimination' in the context of Zionist settler-colonialism?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The 'logic of elimination' in the context of Zionist settler-colonialism refers to the ideological and practical framework developed by Zionist settlers to justify and facilitate the removal of the native Palestinian population from their land. This concept, coined by scholar Patrick Wolfe, is crucial to understanding the strategies and justifications used in the colonization of Palestine. Here's a detailed explanation of the 'logic of elimination':\n1.\nDefinition: The 'logic of elimination' refers to the need for settlers to develop both moral justifications and practical means to remove the native population from the land they aim to colonize.\n2.\nGoal: In the Zionist context, the goal was to establish an exclusive Jewish ethnocracy in Palestine. This necessitated dealing with the fact that the land was already inhabited by a native Palestinian population.\n3.\nMoral justifications: Zionists developed various arguments to justify their claim to the land and the displacement of Palestinians. These included:\n- \"A land without a people for a people without a land\": This slogan denied the existence of a significant native population in Palestine.\n- \"There is no such thing as a Palestinian\": This argument denied the national identity and rights of Palestinians.\n- \"Israel made the desert bloom\": This claim suggested that Palestinians had not properly developed or utilized the land.\n4.\nPractical means: The 'logic of elimination' also involved developing practical strategies to remove Palestinians from the land. These could include:\n- Ethnic cleansing: Forcibly expelling Palestinians from their homes and villages.\n- Genocide: In extreme cases, the physical destruction of the native population.\n- Ethnocide: Destroying Palestinian culture, identity, and way of life.\n5.\nDenial of Palestinian peoplehood: By portraying Palestinians as \"disconnected communities\" or \"wandering rootless vagabonds,\" Zionists sought to delegitimize Palestinian claims to the land.\n6.\nParallels with other colonial contexts: The denial of Palestinian existence and rights resembles arguments used by colonists worldwide, such as the Terra Nullius argument used to justify the colonization of Australia.\n7.\nSegregation policies: The 'logic of elimination' was also reflected in policies that sought to separate Jewish and Palestinian communities, such as the formation of segregated trade unions that banned non-Jewish members.\n8.\nLong-term strategy: The 'logic of elimination' wasn't just about immediate removal but also about creating conditions that would make it impossible for Palestinians to return or maintain their connection to the land.\n9.\nContinuation beyond initial settlement: The 'logic of elimination' persisted even after the establishment of Israel, influencing policies towards Palestinian refugees and Palestinians living under Israeli control.\n10.\nImpact on peace efforts: This underlying logic has made genuine coexistence difficult, as it fundamentally rejects the idea of equal rights for Palestinians in their homeland. Understanding the 'logic of elimination' is crucial for comprehending the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as it reveals the foundational ideology behind Zionist settler-colonialism and its long-lasting impacts on Palestinian rights and existence."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How did the Palestinian population initially respond to the arrival of Zionist settlers?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The initial response of the Palestinian population to the arrival of Zionist settlers was largely welcoming and cooperative, contrary to later tensions and conflicts. This early interaction is important to understand as it highlights that the conflict was not inevitable but developed over time due to Zionist policies and intentions. Here's a detailed explanation of the initial Palestinian response:\n1.\nWelcoming attitude: There is ample evidence, recorded by the Zionist pioneers themselves, that the native Palestinian population was initially welcoming of the first Zionist settlers.\n2.\nCooperation: Palestinians and early Zionist settlers worked side by side in many instances, demonstrating an initial willingness to coexist.\n3.\nKnowledge sharing: Palestinians taught the new settlers how to work the land, sharing their agricultural expertise despite the Zionists often viewing Palestinians as inferior and uncivilized.\n4.\nLong history of coexistence: The text mentions that Palestine has historically been a place of refuge for diverse populations fleeing war and famine, including Armenian, Bosnian, and even Indian Palestinians. This history suggests a tradition of welcoming newcomers.\n5.\nNo inherent opposition to Jewish immigration: The issue was not with the idea of Zionists moving to Palestine per se. Palestinians had lived alongside Jewish communities for centuries.\n6.\nShift in attitudes: The welcoming attitude began to change only when it became clear that the Zionist settlers did not come to live in Palestine as equals, but to become its landlords.\n7.\nRealization of Zionist intentions: As Zionist policies of exclusion and separation became apparent, Palestinians began to perceive Zionism as a threat.\n8.\nExample of policy change: Zionist leadership went out of its way to sanction settlers employing or working with Palestinians, calling Palestinian labor an \"illness\" and forming a segregated trade union that banned non-Jewish members.\n9.\nResistance emergence: Consequently, as with every colonial situation, resistance by the native population emerged. This resistance was aimed at both the British administrators and the Zionist settlers.\n10.\nHistorical context: The text mentions that there had been no significant tension between Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine for nearly a century prior to the arrival of Zionist settlers, as noted in the Shaw report. This initial welcoming response from Palestinians underscores that the conflict was not rooted in inherent animosity or antisemitism, but rather developed as a reaction to Zionist policies of exclusion and the clear intention to establish dominance over the land and its native inhabitants. The change in Palestinian attitudes was a direct result of the realization that Zionist settlers sought not coexistence, but domination and displacement of the native population."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What was the demographic and land ownership situation in Palestine by the end of the mandate period?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "By the end of the mandate period, the demographic and land ownership situation in Palestine was significantly different from what Zionist propaganda often claimed. The text provides specific details about this situation:\n1.\nLand ownership:\n- Despite extensive efforts by the Zionist movement to purchase as much land as possible, they only controlled 5-6% of the land in mandatory Palestine by the end of the mandate period.\n- This small percentage of land ownership is in stark contrast to the Zionist slogan of \"A land without a people for a people without a land,\" which implied that Palestine was largely empty or unused.\n2.\nPopulation demographics:\n- The Zionist settlers constituted only about one-third of the total population of Palestine by the end of the mandate.\n- This means that approximately two-thirds of the population were native Palestinians.\n3.\nRecent arrival:\n- The text emphasizes that this Zionist population had \"only just arrived,\" indicating that the majority were recent immigrants rather than long-standing inhabitants.\n4.\nGeographic distribution:\n- The Zionist population did not amount to a clear majority in any region of Palestine.\n- This lack of a majority in any specific area is significant because it undermined claims for territorial control based on population concentration.\n5.\nImplications for statehood:\n- The text states that this population distribution would make establishing an exclusivist Zionist state in Palestine impossible without further measures.\n- This demographic reality was a major factor in the subsequent events, including the push for partition and the eventual ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.\n6.\nHistorical context:\n- The text mentions that the bulk of the Zionist population arrived in Palestine during the 4th and 5th Zionist immigration waves (Aliyot) between 1924-1939.\n  - This means that the majority of those demanding partition of the land had been living there for 20 years at most.\n7.\nContrast with partition plans:\n- Despite owning only 5-6% of the land and constituting one-third of the population, Zionist leaders were pushing for control over much larger portions of Palestine.\n- For instance, the UN partition plan of 1947 would have allotted approximately 56% of the land of mandatory Palestine to the Zionist state. This demographic and land ownership situation at the end of the mandate period is crucial for understanding the subsequent events. It highlights the disparity between Zionist claims and aspirations and the realities on the ground, and helps explain why Palestinians rejected partition plans that would have given the majority of the land to a minority, recently-arrived population. This situation also underscores why the Zionist leadership felt that further measures, including ethnic cleansing, were necessary to establish a Jewish majority state in Palestine."}]}
