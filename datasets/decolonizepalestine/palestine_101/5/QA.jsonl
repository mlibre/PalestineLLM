It means refusing to buy, use, or participate in something as a way of protesting. In the context of BDS, it encourages people to stop buying Israeli products or engaging with Israeli services as a form of protest until the goals of the movement are met."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does the 'D' in BDS stand for and what does it mean?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The 'D' in BDS stands for Disinvestment. It means the withdrawal of investments. In the context of BDS, it encourages different institutions and organizations to sell their stock in any company that profits or benefits from Israeli oppression of the Palestinians, or to refuse to invest in any such company or organization."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What does the 'S' in BDS stand for and what does it mean?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The 'S' in BDS stands for Sanctions.

In the context of BDS, it means pressuring Israel to obey international laws by limiting or stopping trade with it, or by cutting off economic aid."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How many goals does the BDS movement have?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement has three goals."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the first goal of the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The first goal of the BDS movement is ending Israeli occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What do the goals of the BDS movement represent in terms of international law?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The goals of the BDS movement represent the consistent application of international law."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Why was the BDS movement created?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement was created because, despite numerous UN resolutions calling on Israel to cease its violations of international law, Israel saw no reason to comply in the absence of real pressure from the international community. The organizers of BDS sought an effective way to push Israel to change its policies through non-violent, international, legal and popular pressure."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What inspired the creation of the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement was inspired by the successful BDS campaign carried out against Apartheid South Africa, which played an instrumental role in pressuring that regime."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Does the BDS movement call for the destruction of Israel?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "No, the BDS movement does not call for the destruction of Israel. This is a common misconception and baseless smear directed against the movement. The goals of the movement, as stated in its call for action, do not include destruction of Israel. The movement is purely a human rights movement and takes no position on political solutions."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement respond to accusations that it singles out Israel for punishment?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement responds to these accusations by explaining that it is an issue-specific movement focused on the Palestinian question, started by Palestinians regarding their own issue. It is not a universal scale of justice addressing global issues. Furthermore, they argue that if Israel is being singled out for anything, it is for its impunity to any real consequences for its violations of international law, despite being one of the world's leading countries in violating and ignoring UNSC resolutions."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Does the BDS movement harm academic freedom?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement argues that it does not harm academic freedom. While Israeli academia has a history of complicity with and support for Israeli colonialism, the BDS movement does not target individual Israeli persons, whether academic or otherwise, but mainly targets Israeli institutions and those representing them in an official capacity. The movement also points out that concerns about academic freedom are often selectively applied, with little protest from Israeli academics when Palestinian academic institutions are targeted or closed."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Does the BDS movement target individual Israelis?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "No, the BDS movement does not target random Israeli individuals. It targets the Israeli government, as well as institutions, organizations and their representatives which are complicit in the repression and dispossession of Palestinians."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Why doesn't the BDS movement only target illegal Israeli settlements?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement argues that targeting only illegal settlements is insufficient and impractical for several reasons: 1) Settlements are not self-perpetuating but are actively supported and incentivized by the Israeli government. 2) Israel's violations of international law are not limited to the areas occupied in 1967 but extend to all the land it controls. 3) Practically, it's difficult to separate settlement economies from the broader Israeli economy as many Israelis commute daily across the Green Line for work."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement respond to claims that it harms Palestinian workers?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement responds to these claims by arguing that: 1) While some Palestinians might lose jobs in the short term, ending the occupation would create many more job opportunities for Palestinians in the long term. 2) The BDS call came from Palestinian civil society, including labor unions, who remain signatories. 3) Support for BDS among Palestinians is nearly unanimous. 4) This argument is similar to those used against boycotting Apartheid South Africa and is seen as a cynical attempt to maintain the status quo."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How effective is the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The effectiveness of the BDS movement is difficult to measure precisely, as many of its effects are non-material in nature. However, some indicators of its impact include: Economic impact: A RAND Corporation study estimated that BDS could cost Israel close to 2% of its GDP (about $9 billion per year) by the mid-2020s. Israeli response: Israel has moved responsibility for combating BDS to the Ministry of Strategic Affairs, indicating they view it as a serious concern. International efforts: Pro-Israel groups have hosted secret conferences and pushed for criminalization of BDS in some U.S. states. Awareness raising: The movement has been effective in raising awareness and shifting conversations about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The movement's strength lies not just in its economic impact, but in its ability to raise awareness, speak truth to power, and bring to light parallels that Israel finds difficult to combat. Its grassroots, participatory nature makes it a significant concern for Israel beyond just economic losses."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the BDS movement's stance on cultural boycotts?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement's stance on cultural boycotts is that it does not target individual Israeli artists, but rather institutions or those complicit in the oppression of Palestinians and the whitewashing of Israeli crimes. The movement argues that Israel often uses cultural events and activities to improve its image abroad and divert attention from its human rights violations. Therefore, the BDS movement sees cultural boycotts as a necessary part of its overall strategy to pressure Israel to comply with international law."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement respond to accusations of antisemitism?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement responds to accusations of antisemitism by emphasizing that it is a human rights movement focused on Palestinian rights and Israeli compliance with international law. It argues that its goals are based on universal principles of human rights and international law, not on targeting Jewish people. The movement points out that many of its supporters, including Jewish individuals and organizations, reject the notion that criticizing Israeli policies is inherently antisemitic. The BDS movement maintains that conflating criticism of Israeli state policies with antisemitism is an attempt to deflect attention from legitimate human rights concerns."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the BDS movement's position on the two-state solution?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement does not take an official position on any specific political solution, including the two-state solution. It is primarily a rights-based movement focused on achieving its three stated goals: ending the occupation, equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. The movement leaves it to Palestinians to determine the political outcome they desire once their rights are fulfilled. Individual supporters of BDS may have their own views on political solutions, but these do not represent the official stance of the movement."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement define 'Arab lands' in its first goal?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "In its first goal, which calls for 'ending Israeli occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall,' the BDS movement generally refers to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. However, the movement does not provide a specific definition of 'Arab lands' in its official materials, leaving some room for interpretation. The focus is on ending occupation and colonization in accordance with international law."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement view Palestinian citizens of Israel?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement views Palestinian citizens of Israel as facing systemic discrimination and inequality within Israel. This is reflected in its second goal, which calls for 'recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality.' The movement argues that these citizens, while having some rights, do not enjoy full equality with Jewish Israeli citizens in various aspects of life, including laws, policies, and social practices. The BDS movement seeks to address this inequality as part of its broader campaign for Palestinian rights."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is UN Resolution 194, and why is it important to the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "UN Resolution 194 is a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1948. It is important to the BDS movement because it addresses the rights of Palestinian refugees. Specifically, the resolution states that 'refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.' The BDS movement includes the implementation of this resolution as its third goal, calling for 'respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.' This goal is central to the BDS movement's advocacy for Palestinian refugee rights, which it sees as a key component of achieving justice for Palestinians."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement differ from other forms of Palestinian resistance?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement differs from other forms of Palestinian resistance in several key ways: Non-violent approach: BDS is explicitly non-violent, relying on economic, academic, and cultural pressure rather than armed resistance. International focus: While many forms of Palestinian resistance are localized, BDS actively seeks international participation and support. Grassroots nature: BDS is a decentralized, grassroots movement, as opposed to resistance organized by political parties or armed groups. Rights-based framework: BDS frames its goals in terms of international law and human rights, rather than specific political outcomes. Broad participation: BDS allows for participation by individuals and organizations worldwide, not just Palestinians. Long-term strategy: Unlike more immediate forms of resistance, BDS is designed as a long-term campaign to gradually increase pressure on Israel. The movement presents itself as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, other forms of legitimate Palestinian resistance."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement view normalization efforts between Israel and Arab states?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement generally opposes normalization efforts between Israel and Arab states, viewing them as undermining Palestinian rights and the struggle for justice. The movement argues that such normalization: Rewards Israel without requiring it to end its violations of Palestinian rights. Weakens collective Arab leverage in supporting Palestinian rights. Legitimizes Israel's policies of occupation, colonization, and apartheid. Ignores the root causes of the conflict and the rights of Palestinians. The BDS movement calls for conditioning normalization on Israel's compliance with international law and respect for Palestinian rights. It encourages Arab states and peoples to maintain their commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative, which offers normalization in exchange for a full Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories and a just solution for Palestinian refugees."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the BDS movement's stance on violence?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement is explicitly committed to non-violent means of resistance. It advocates for peaceful forms of pressure on Israel through boycotts, divestment, and sanctions. The movement does not endorse or promote any form of violence against individuals or states. However, it's worth noting that while the BDS movement itself is non-violent, it does not condemn other forms of Palestinian resistance, including armed resistance, which is considered legitimate under international law for people living under occupation. The movement focuses on promoting its own non-violent strategies rather than commenting on or directing other forms of resistance."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement define 'apartheid' in relation to Israel?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement uses the term 'apartheid' to describe Israel's treatment of Palestinians based on the definition in international law, particularly the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. They argue that Israel's policies and practices meet the legal definition of apartheid, which is described as systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another.Specifically, the BDS movement points to: Different legal systems for Palestinians and Israelis in the occupied territories.Restrictions on Palestinian movement, residence, and land ownership. Segregation of infrastructure and services. Unequal allocation of resources and rights based on ethnic identity. The movement argues that these policies, both within Israel proper and in the occupied territories, constitute a system of apartheid as defined by international law. It's important to note that this use of the term is contested by Israel and its supporters."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is BDS and when was it formed?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "BDS stands for Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions. It is a non-violent human rights campaign formed in 2005 by over 170 Palestinian non-governmental organizations, unions and civil society groups. The aim of the movement is to campaign for and protect the rights of Palestinians through the application of international pressure on Israel until it complies with international law."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What are the three main components of BDS?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The three main components of BDS are: Boycott: Refusing to buy, use, or participate in Israeli products or services as a form of protest. Disinvestment: Encouraging institutions and organizations to sell their stock in companies that profit from Israeli oppression of Palestinians or refusing to invest in such companies.

Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "Why was the BDS movement created?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement was created because: Israel has been the target of dozens of UNSC and UNGA resolutions calling on it to cease its violations of international law, but in the absence of real pressure, Israel saw no reason to comply. One year after the International Court of Justice deemed Israel's wall illegal and the UN General Assembly voted for Israel to comply with this opinion, there was still no effective pressure on the Israeli government to change its policies. The founders sought an effective way to push Israel to change its policies through non-violent, international, legal, and popular pressure, inspired by the successful BDS campaign against Apartheid South Africa."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement function?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement functions through its three main components: Boycott: People are encouraged to stop buying Israeli products or engaging with Israeli services as a form of protest. Disinvestment: Institutions and organizations are encouraged to sell their stock in companies that profit from Israeli oppression of Palestinians or to refuse to invest in such companies. Sanctions: This involves pressuring Israel to obey international laws by limiting or stopping trade with it, or by cutting off economic aid. While the movement is decentralized and functions through local organizations, groups, and grassroots efforts in each area, the BDS National Council (BNC) and The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) serve as a compass for the movement, introducing guidelines and revisions, and deliberating on particularly tricky cases."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the main criticism against BDS regarding Israel's existence?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The main criticism against BDS regarding Israel's existence is the claim that BDS calls for the destruction of Israel. This is described in the text as \"perhaps the most common baseless smear directed against the BDS movement.\" Critics argue that the movement's third goal, which calls for respecting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, would threaten Israel's Jewish majority. However, the text clarifies that the BDS movement takes no position on political solutions and is purely a human rights movement. It does not call for the destruction of Israel, but rather for the dismantling of discriminatory and colonial policies."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does the BDS movement respond to accusations of singling out Israel?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement responds to accusations of singling out Israel by pointing out several key factors: BDS was started by Palestinians specifically regarding their own issue. It's not a universal scale of justice, but an issue-specific movement focused on the Palestinian question. This argument is seen as an implicit admission of guilt, as it doesn't deny Israel's wrongdoing but seeks to distract by pointing fingers at others. The movement argues that if Israel is being singled out for anything, it's for its impunity to real consequences for its violations, despite being one of the world's leading countries in violating and ignoring UNSC resolutions. Israel is afforded special privileges, trade offers, and partnerships not available to other serial violators of human rights, while still being considered a democratic, civilized first-world country. The movement also points out that this argument is often used as a distraction tactic, with violators in other countries being instrumentalized without real interest in their impact."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does BDS address concerns about harming academic freedom?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "BDS addresses concerns about harming academic freedom in several ways: The movement points out that Israeli academia has a long history of complicity with and active support for Israeli colonialism. BDS does not target individual Israeli persons, but mainly Israeli institutions and those representing them in an official capacity. The movement questions the sincerity of those championing academic freedom, noting that Israeli academics have been largely silent on violations of Palestinian academic freedom. They cite an example where only 4% of Israeli academics agreed to sign a petition denouncing an attack on a Palestinian university. BDS argues that this sudden interest in academic freedom should be understood as an insincere and cynical pretext to demonize the movement. The movement maintains that its actions are necessary to address the broader issues of Palestinian rights and Israeli policies, even if they may impact some aspects of Israeli academia."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the BDS movement's stance on boycotting Israeli culture?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement's stance on boycotting Israeli culture is as follows: BDS does not target individual Israeli artists. The movement does target institutions or those complicit in the oppression of Palestinians and the whitewashing of Israeli crimes. BDS recognizes that Israel uses cultural means to improve its image abroad and divert attention from its oppression of Palestinians. The movement sees cultural activities as potentially complicit in oppression when they contribute to whitewashing Israel's image. BDS draws parallels to how Apartheid South Africa used cultural events to change perceptions of the racist state. In essence, the BDS movement does include a cultural boycott, but it is targeted at institutions and official representations rather than individual artists. The movement argues that this is necessary to counter Israel's use of culture as a tool for improving its international image at the expense of Palestinian rights."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does BDS respond to claims that it harms Palestinian workers?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "BDS responds to claims that it harms Palestinian workers in several ways: The movement points out that while approximately 120,000 Palestinians work in settlements and inside the green line, it's estimated that these settlements and occupation policies cost Palestinians 110,000 jobs per year. BDS argues that without Israeli control over the Palestinian economy and settlement theft of resources, Palestinians could have created nearly two million new jobs since 2000. The movement emphasizes that the BDS call to action came from Palestinian civil society, including labor and trade unions who remain signatories. BDS notes that support for the movement among Palestinians is virtually unanimous, with any concerns being about effectiveness rather than potential harm. The movement draws parallels to similar arguments used against boycotting Apartheid South Africa, suggesting that such concerns are often cynically motivated. BDS argues that supporting the movement to end occupation is a better way to improve the situation for Palestinian workers in the long term. Overall, BDS contends that while some Palestinian workers might be temporarily affected, the overall impact of the movement would be beneficial for Palestinian labor in the long run."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the main argument for why BDS should not be restricted to just illegal Israeli settlements?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The main argument for why BDS should not be restricted to just illegal Israeli settlements is multi-faceted: Settlements and other illegal policies are not self-perpetuating or occurring in a vacuum. They are actively built, maintained, protected, and developed by Israel as part of its broader policies. Israel incentivizes the transfer of its population into settlements by declaring them 'National Priority areas,' providing generous state subsidies in areas like housing and education. Israel's violations of international law are not limited to areas occupied in the 1967 war, but extend to the entirety of the land it controls, including inside the green line. Practically, a targeted boycott of only settlements is unfeasible. On the ground, the green line doesn't exist for Israelis, with hundreds of thousands of settlers commuting to work over it daily. For all intents and purposes, the settlements are part of Israel, not a neat separate entity that can be easily singled out for boycotts. In essence, the argument is that focusing solely on settlements ignores the broader context of Israeli policies and the practical realities of how settlements are integrated into Israeli society and economy."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How effective is the BDS movement according to the text?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The text presents a nuanced view of the BDS movement's effectiveness: It acknowledges that concretely measuring BDS's effectiveness is difficult, especially for non-material effects like concert cancellations or reluctance to host Israelis. Economically, a RAND Corporation study estimates BDS could cost Israel about 2% of its GDP (around $9 billion annually) in the next decade if current trends continue. The text argues that Israel's fear of BDS appears genuine, citing actions like moving responsibility for combating BDS to the Ministry of Strategic Affairs and efforts to criminalize BDS in some U.S. states. The real power of BDS is said to lie beyond its material effects, in its ability to raise awareness, speak truth to power, and draw parallels that Israel struggles to combat. The movement's strength is in its discursive ability to shift conversations and its grassroots, participatory nature. As BDS becomes more mainstream among activists and on campuses worldwide, the text suggests its strength will grow. Overall, while the economic impact is notable, the text emphasizes that BDS's main effectiveness lies in its ability to change narratives and raise awareness about the Palestinian situation."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What inspired the creation of the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement was inspired by the successful BDS campaign carried out against Apartheid South Africa. The founders of the BDS movement saw how international pressure through boycotts, divestment, and sanctions played an instrumental role in cornering the Apartheid regime in South Africa. They sought to apply a similar strategy to pressure Israel to comply with international law and respect Palestinian rights. This inspiration is explicitly mentioned in the text when discussing the reasons for creating the BDS movement."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does BDS view Israel's compliance with international law?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to the text, BDS views Israel's compliance with international law as severely lacking. The movement points out that: Israel has been the target of dozens of UNSC and UNGA resolutions calling on it to cease its violations of international law. In the absence of any real pressure from the international community, Israel has seen no reason to comply with these resolutions. Israel's settlement enterprise in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights is cited as an instance of its 'brazen contempt for international and humanitarian law.' The movement specifically mentions Israel's noncompliance with the International Court of Justice's advisory opinion deeming the construction of Israel's wall illegal. BDS sees Israel as one of the world's leading countries when it comes to violating and ignoring UNSC resolutions. The BDS movement was created precisely because of this perceived lack of compliance, aiming to apply non-violent, international, legal, and popular pressure to push Israel to change its policies and adhere to international law."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What role do the BDS National Council (BNC) and The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) play in the BDS movement?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "According to the text, the BDS National Council (BNC) and The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) play a crucial role in the BDS movement: They serve as a compass for the movement. They introduce guidelines and revisions for the movement. They deliberate on particularly tricky cases that arise within the context of the boycott. While the BDS movement is described as decentralized and functioning through local organizations, groups, and grassroots efforts in each area, the BNC and PACBI provide direction and guidance to ensure consistency and effectiveness across the movement's various initiatives."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does BDS respond to the argument that it should focus only on products from illegal settlements?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "BDS responds to the argument that it should focus only on products from illegal settlements in several ways: They argue that settlements and other illegal policies are not self-perpetuating, but are actively supported and maintained by Israel as a whole. Israel incentivizes settlement expansion by declaring them 'National Priority areas' and providing generous state subsidies. Israel's violations of international law are not limited to post-1967 occupied territories, but extend to all land it controls, including within the Green Line. Practically, a targeted boycott of only settlements is unfeasible because the Green Line doesn't exist for Israelis in everyday life. Many settlers commute to work over the Green Line daily. Settlements are effectively part of Israel, not a separate entity that can be easily singled out for boycotts. This approach would ignore the broader context of Israeli policies and the integration of settlements into Israeli society and economy. In essence, BDS argues that focusing solely on settlement products would be both impractical and insufficient to address the broader issues of Israeli policies and practices affecting Palestinians."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "What is the BDS movement's stance on targeting individual Israelis?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement's stance on targeting individual Israelis is clear: BDS does not target individual Israeli persons, whether they are academics, artists, or others, purely for being Israeli. The movement primarily targets Israeli institutions and those representing them in an official capacity. In the context of academic boycott, an Israeli professor would not be boycotted purely for being Israeli. Regarding cultural boycott, BDS does not target individual Israeli artists. The movement focuses on institutions or individuals who are complicit in the oppression of Palestinians and the whitewashing of Israeli crimes. The text emphasizes that the BDS movement is about targeting systems and institutions rather than individuals based solely on their nationality. This approach aims to pressure the Israeli state and complicit institutions without discriminating against individuals simply because of their Israeli citizenship."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "How does BDS view the argument that it harms sympathetic Israelis?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "The BDS movement addresses the argument that it harms sympathetic Israelis by emphasizing that: The movement does not target random Israeli individuals. BDS targets the Israeli government, as well as institutions, organizations, and their representatives which are complicit in the repression and dispossession of Palestinians. The movement's focus is on systemic issues and institutional complicity, not on individual Israelis who may be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. In essence, BDS maintains that its actions are not aimed at harming individual Israelis, whether sympathetic or not, but rather at pressuring the Israeli state and institutions that are directly involved in or benefit from the occupation and oppression of Palestinians. The movement sees this approach as necessary to address the broader issues of Palestinian rights and Israeli policies, even if some sympathetic Israelis might be indirectly affected."}]}
