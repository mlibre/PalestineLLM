The goal is to generate high-quality data for training a language model.
Ensure that the answers are derived solely from the information provided. Do not provide responses based on external knowledge or assumptions.
Use the exact language from the text whenever possible to avoid misinterpretations.

Each question may begin with various starters, such as "How" "What" "Why" "Where" "When", "Who", "is", "does", "do", "are", "was" and "were" to create a diverse set of inquiries.
Generate a minimum of 200 question-answer pairs. ANSWERS could be very long.
Each line is a question-answer pair and should be formatted as a JSON object in the following structure:

```json
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "QUESTION-1"},{"role": "assistant","content": "ANSWER-1"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user","content": "QUESTION-2"},{"role": "assistant","content": "ANSWER-2"}]}
